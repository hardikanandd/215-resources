      portions for data transmission or storage. A checksum is
      basically a calculated summary of such a data portion.</p><p>Network data transmissions often produce errors, such
      as toggled, missing or duplicated bits. As a result, the data
      received might not be identical to the data transmitted,
      which is obviously a bad thing.</p><p>Because of these transmission errors, network protocols
      very often use checksums to detect such errors. The
      transmitter will calculate a checksum of the data and
      transmits the data together with the checksum. The receiver
      will calculate the checksum of the received data with the
      same algorithm as the transmitter. If the received and
      calculated checksums don't match a transmission error has
      occurred.</p><p>Some checksum algorithms are able to recover (simple)
      errors by calculating where the expected error must be and
      repairing it.</p><p>If there are errors that cannot be recovered, the
      receiving side throws away the packet. Depending on the
      network protocol, this data loss is simply ignored or the
      sending side needs to detect this loss somehow and
      retransmits the required packet(s).</p><p>Using a checksum drastically reduces the number of
      undetected transmission errors. However, the usual checksum
      algorithms cannot guarantee an error detection of 100%, so a
      very small number of transmission errors may remain
      undetected.</p><p>There are several different kinds of checksum
      algorithms; an example of an often used checksum algorithm is
      CRC32. The checksum algorithm actually chosen for a specific
      network protocol will depend on the expected error rate of
      the network medium, the importance of error detection, the
      processor load to perform the calculation, the performance
      needed and many other things.</p><p>Further information about checksums can be found at:

      protocols, e.g.: IP, TCP, UDP, ...</p><p>It will do the same calculation as a "normal receiver"
      would do, and shows the checksum fields in the packet details
      with a comment, e.g.: [correct], [invalid, must be
      0x12345678] or alike.</p><p>Checksum validation can be switched off for various
      protocols in the Wireshark protocol preferences, e.g. to
      (very slightly) increase performance.</p><p>If the checksum validation is enabled and it detected
      an invalid checksum, features like packet reassembling won't
      be processed. This is avoided as incorrect connection data
      could "confuse" the internal database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4767700"></a>7.8.2. Checksum offloading</h3></div></div></div><p>The checksum calculation might be done by the network
      driver, protocol driver or even in hardware.</p><p>For example: The Ethernet transmitting hardware
      calculates the Ethernet CRC32 checksum and the receiving
      hardware validates this checksum. If the received checksum is
      wrong Wireshark won't even see the packet, as the Ethernet
      hardware internally throws away the packet.</p><p>Higher level checksums are "traditionally" calculated
      by the protocol implementation and the completed packet is
      then handed over to the hardware.</p><p>Recent network hardware can perform advanced features
      such as IP checksum calculation, also known as checksum
      offloading. The network driver won't calculate the checksum
      itself but will simply hand over an empty (zero or garbage filled)
      checksum field to the hardware.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note: Note!"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="wsug_graphics/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note!</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Checksum offloading often causes confusion as the
        network packets to be transmitted are handed over to
        Wireshark before the checksums are actually calculated.
        Wireshark gets these "empty" checksums and displays them as
        invalid, even though the packets will contain valid
        checksums when they leave the network hardware
        later.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Checksum offloading can be confusing and having a lot
      of [invalid] messages on the screen can be quite annoying. As
      mentioned above, invalid checksums may lead to unreassembled
      packets, making the analysis of the packet data much
      harder.</p><p>You can do two things to avoid this checksum offloading
