      In late 1997, Gerald Combs needed a tool for tracking down
      networking problems and wanted to learn more about networking, so
      he started writing Ethereal (the former name of the Wireshark project)
	  as a way to solve both problems.
    </p><p>
      Ethereal was initially released, after several pauses in development,
      in July 1998 as version 0.2.0.  Within days, patches, bug reports,
      and words of encouragement started arriving, so Ethereal was on its
      way to success.
    </p><p>
      Not long after that, Gilbert Ramirez saw its potential and contributed
      a low-level dissector to it.
    </p><p>
      In October, 1998, Guy Harris of Network Appliance was looking for
	  something better than tcpview, so he started applying patches and
	  contributing dissectors to Ethereal.
    </p><p>
      In late 1998, Richard Sharpe, who was giving TCP/IP courses, saw its
      potential on such courses, and started looking at it to see if it
      supported the protocols he needed. While it didn't at that point,
      new protocols could be easily added.  So he started contributing
      dissectors and contributing patches.
    </p><p>
      The list of people who have contributed to Ethereal has become very long
	  since then, and almost all of them started with a protocol that they
	  needed that Ethereal did not already handle. So they copied an existing
	  dissector and contributed the code back to the team.
    </p><p>
	In 2006 the project moved house and re-emerged under a new name: Wireshark.
