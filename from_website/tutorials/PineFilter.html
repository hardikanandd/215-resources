    <td valign="top" align="left" width="410"> <p>CSD has implemented a new way 
        of marking spam messages. Potential spam or junk mail messages are flagged 
        in the subject line of each message with a "SpamScore". This allows USC
        e-mail users to filter spam and junk mail messages away from their inbox. 
        For more information about CSD's effort against spam go to <a href="http://www.csd.sc.edu/emailservices/spam.shtml">www.csd.sc.edu/emailservices/spam.shtml</a></p>
      <p><strong>Creating a Spam Filter</strong></p>
      <p>Pine's built-in filter function is the natural solution for Pine users
        since it is readily available, easy to use and offers more customization 
        options than most clients. </p>
      <p>1. To set up a filter, type the first letter of each command below: 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>(M)ain<br>
          (S)etup<br>
          (R)ules<br>
          (F)ilter<br>
          (A)dd </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2. Then hit <strong>enter</strong> and name your filter. Something like 
        &quot;possible spam&quot; is a good descriptive name.  <strong>Enter</strong> 
	again to save the name.
      <p>3. Now scroll down to just below <strong>FILTERED MESSAGE CONDITIONS 
        BEGIN HERE</strong> and place  your cursor on<strong> Subject pattern </strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.
<p>4. In the space provided, enter the following, exactly as it 
	reads here (and then <strong>enter</strong>): 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>{SpamScore: sss</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>5. Scroll down to <strong>Message is New?</strong> and type a <strong>*</strong> 
        on <strong>Yes</strong>. 
      <p>6. Scroll down to <strong>ACTIONS BEGIN HERE</strong>. Under <strong>
	Filter Action </strong> put the cursor on <strong>Folder List =</strong> 	and hit <strong>enter</strong>. 
        Enter the name of the folder where you want to put possible spam, such 
        as &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;potential-spam&quot; to remind 
	yourself that it could contain <a href= "http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3315541">false positives</a>. 
      <p>7. Then, to save: 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>(E)xit Setup<br>
          (Y)es -- to save<br>
          (Y)es -- to create new folder<br>
          (E)xit Setup<br>
          (Y)es -- to save</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>8. Your new spam filter rule is saved. </p>
      <p>9. Remember to check this <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>potential-spam</strong> 
        folder regularly to catch any legitimate mail incorrectly marked as spam. 
        Also be sure to delete the rest of the spam which collects there, so your 
        quota is not exceeded.</p> 


      <h3><strong>Using Procmail Instead of Pine</strong></h3>
      <p>If you already have a procmail filter and would rather use that for
        filtering potential spam, simply add some recipes to your procmailrc&#8212; 
        see the examples below. However, if you prefer to use Pine's filter, you 
        can do so without changing anything in procmail.</p>
      <p> <strong>.procmailrc example </strong></p>
      <p><tt># Comments begin with # <br>
	     # Messages with a score of 5 or <br>
	     # higher are almost certainly spam. <br>
             # Send to almost-certainly-spam folder.</p>
      <p>    :0:<br>
             * ^{SpamScore: sssss<br>
             almost-certainly-spam</p>
      <p><strong>end .procmailrc example</strong><br>
        <br>
        As above with Pine filtering, you can use either or both of these filtering 
        rules. For both, be sure to keep them in the order shown, or the X-Spam-Level 
        rule will not be applied. </p>
