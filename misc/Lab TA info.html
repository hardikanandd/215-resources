</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>1.  Lab Combination:
 </B>xxxxx<B> </B>(<B><U>DO NOT</U> </B>distribute this to your
students)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>2.  Sumwalt 340
Office number: </B> 7-5609 (on campus) 777-5609 (off campus)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>3.  Office hours: 
</B>If you are teaching lecture, or 4 to 6 lab sections, you are
required to post and keep 3 office hours per week.  If you are
teaching 1 to 3 lab sections, you are required to keep 2 office hours
per week.  <B>Note:</B>  there will be a number of times where no
students will stop by during your office hours.  This is especially
true early in the semester.  It is important that you keep these
hours anyway.  As the semester progresses, more students (both 101
and 102) will come to you for help and it is important that you be
available during these hours to help anyone needing assistance.  . 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>4.  Email address: 
</B>You need to post an email address for your students to contact
you.  You are required to use your cse or engr email address for
this.  It is important that you check this email address regularly. 
Checking it once a day during weekdays is acceptable.  It&rsquo;s ok
to be less diligent over the weekends and holidays, but try and check
it occasionally during these times.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>5.  Class web site: 
</B>You will need to create and post a class web site on the Computer
Science department&rsquo;s web server.  This web page should contain
your class information (section number, meeting times, etc) and
contact information (office number, location, hours, office phone,
email address, and any other relevant contact information you wish to
provide).  You will need to log in to the computer science secure web
site (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="https://www.cse.sc.edu/">https://www.cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>)
and sign the web consent form before you will be able to post your
site.  It is important that site be up and running by Monday, August
23d.  For examples of how these sites can be designed, you can refer
to <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~rossam2">www.cse.sc.edu/~rossam2</A></U></FONT>
for a stylish look for your web page, and <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~mckayj">www.cse.sc.edu/~mckayj</A></U></FONT>
for a plain, utilitarian view of a class homepage.  DO NOT POST LAB
SOLUTIONS ON THE WEB.  Other labs may be doing similar assignments
and have different schedules.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>6.  Mailing lists: 
</B>You will need to subscribe to the Csce101-102 mailing list (and
possibly the Csce101 mailing list) both of which can be found on the
Computer Science department home page (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.cse.sc.edu/">www.cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>).
 The 101-102 mailing list is intended to be used to notify all
Sumwalt instructors of any lab problems, or other general information
that they may need.  If you encounter a problem with one of the labs
that you are unable to handle, please send an email to this list
notifying everyone of the problem.  The Csce101 list is intended for
lab and lecture instructors of CSCE 101 to share information relevant
to their class.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>7.  Keys and Copier
Code:  </B>You will need to go to the Computer Science department
office in Swearingen, third floor, and talk to Julie, Beverly or
Jewel about obtaining a key and a copier code to use the photocopier
in the computer science department in Swearingen.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>8.  Catherine
Matthews:  </B>is the primary person to contact if you have problems
or questions about CSCE 101 or 102.  Her office number is 7-2427 and
her email is <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="mailto:cmatthew@cse.sc.edu">cmatthew@cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>
 You should post her contact information on your web site and on your
syllabus(if you are creating one) and mention that if students have
any problems with the class or any matters that they don&rsquo;t feel
comfortable bringing to you, they can talk to her.  It is also
important that you mention this on the first day of class.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>9.  Weekly/Bi-weekly
Meetings:  </B>A weekly or bi-weekly meeting will be scheduled to
allow all lab and lecture instructors to make sure they are all
covering the same material and are roughly in the same place in the
text.  Lab instructors will need to provide current grade sheets to
the lecture instructors at these meetings.  The time for these
meetings will be scheduled as soon as possible.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>10.  Login/Passwords
for Sumwalt Computers:  </B>Your login (and students logins) should
be posted on the lab doors in Sumwalt 361 and Sumwalt 244.  The
initial password for these accounts is your social security number. 
Once you (or the students) login for the first time, you will be
asked to change your password.  Make sure you mention to your
students that they remember their password.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>11.  Printing in the
Sumwalt labs:  </B>Please limit the amount of stuff you print in the
Sumwalt labs.  It&rsquo;s ok to print up the occasional short
document, or web site you need, but if you need to do any serious
printing (long papers, term papers, etc.) you need to print these in
the labs in Swearingen and use your 500 page print quota there. 
Although there is no electronically enforced print quota in the
Sumwalt labs, printer use is monitored.  An easy rule of thumb is to
keep your printing in Sumwalt under 200 pages per semester.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>12.  Preparation: 
</B>It is important that you prepare for your lab or lectures in
advance.  This means having read and familiarized yourself will all
the relevant material and having tested it out to make sure it works
as you expect it to in the labs.  You need to actually test what you
plan on presenting <B><U>in the labs</U></B>.  Something you&rsquo;ve
tested at home on your computer (where you most likely have
administrator privileges) and in the labs (where you are simply a
high-class user) can yield completely different results.  This is
further complicated by the fact that the Sumwalt labs are on a mostly
self-contained network, with considerable security.  <B>Make sure you
test in advance.</B>  There are few things as embarrassing for an
instructor as to stand up and explain something and then have it not
work.   
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>13.  Campus Police
Number:  777-4215</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should you encounter
some kind of problem that you are unable to handle, or if you in some
situation where you feel unsafe, you should call the campus police. 
If you have a situation where you are in doubt whether it is
dangerous or not, err on the side of caution and call the police.  If
you have to think about it, the situation is probably potentially
dangerous.  Also, the campus police are the people to call if you
have a problem getting into the building because of the doors being
locked.  Your office key should open the front doors to the building,
but if you have problems, call them.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>14.  Try and make
the class enjoyable for the students:  </B>Try and make CSCE 101 and
102 a fun class to take.  Even if you don&rsquo;t actually enjoy the
material, try and pretend like you do.  Look for little extras and
tricks you can show your students that will allow them to do &ldquo;neat&rdquo;
things on the computer.  You should try and avoid showing your
students any overly complicated &ldquo;tricks&rdquo;, but something
simple that has a dramatic visual effect is usually the best type. 
Try and get your students excited and keep them excited throughout
the class.  You will find that most students enjoy the web page
creation (XHTML/HTML) aspects of the class the most.  Try and use
this to keep their energy up and to keep it up through some of the
less enjoyable topics.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>15.  Troubleshooting
in Lab:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- If a row of
computers, or three side-by-side go dead, look for something
unplugged.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- If you&rsquo;re
helping a student fix a file, and you can&rsquo;t find any errors,
make sure the file being edited and viewed is the same file, not a
file with the same name in a different directory.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- Don&rsquo;t cut and
paste HTML/XHTML from Microsoft Word into notepad.  This will change
your quote marks into something that looks like quotes but that
aren&rsquo;t actually quotes.  This is an error you may never notice.
 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>16.  Sign-in sheets:
 </B>Each day during your labs, you will need to send around a
sign-in sheet for the students present in lab to sign.  These should
be placed in the green box on the desk in Sumwalt 340.  These are
used to monitor lab attendance and usage as well as to help with
troubleshooting and computer abuse problems.  There should be some
available on the desk in the labs.  If there aren&rsquo;t, you can
just use a piece of paper.  You can also print them up.  The
documents are located at:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>17.  Don&rsquo;t
modify your user environment too much:  </B>Try and avoid doing too
much customization to your windows desktop/environment.  It would be
best for what you present on the overhead to your students to look as
similar to theirs as possible.  Some differences are unavoidable, but
try and minimize these by not adding or changing your desktop a great
deal.  Adding extra useful icons is fine; just avoid doing anything
&ldquo;weird&rdquo;.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>18.  Mapping the
students H: drive for grading:</B>  You need to right click on the My
Computer icon on your desktop, select Map Network drive, then select
a drive letter you like, and for the folder put in:  
<B>\\cl.engr.sc.edu\users</B>  and this will map the drive.  All
students work should be saved on their H: drive.  This work may or
may not also be dropped in the CSE drop box for grading as well.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>19.  Useful
Resources:  </B>Teaching a class or lab for the first time can often
be a nerve-wracking experience.  Simply getting adjusted to standing
up and talking in front of 24 to 72 people for 50 minutes can be
quite a shock.  If at any point you start to feel like you&rsquo;re
overwhelmed it&rsquo;s a good idea to talk to someone who has
survived this stuff.  As mentioned above, you can talk to Catherine
Matthews.  You can also talk to one of the other TA&rsquo;s that have
done this before.  Orren Mckay (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="mailto:mckayj@cse.sc.edu">mckayj@cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>),
Amy Ross (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="mailto:rossam2@cse.sc.edu">rossam2@cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>),
Maryam Jafari-Lafti (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="mailto:mjafaril@cse.sc.edu">mjafaril@cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>)
or Jamie Huenefeld (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="mailto:jmhuenef@cse.sc.edu">jmhuenef@cse.sc.edu</A></U></FONT>)
would all be good people to talk to if you have questions or just
feel you need a little encouragement.
