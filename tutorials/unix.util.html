<h1>How To Look Like A UNIX Guru</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/%7Eparrt"><b> Terence Parr</b></a>

</p><p>Last updated: August 30, 2006

</p><p>UNIX is an extremely popular platform for deploying server software
partly because of its security and stability, but also because it has
a rich set of command line and scripting tools.  Programmers use these
tools for manipulating the file system, processing log files, and
generally automating as much as possible.

</p><p>If you want to be a serious server developer, you will need to have a
certain facility with a number of UNIX tools; about 15.  You will
start to see similarities among them, particularly regular
expressions, and soon you will feel very comfortable.  Combining the
simple commands, you can build very powerful tools very quickly--much
faster than you could build the equivalent functionality in C or Java,
for example.

</p><p>This lecture takes you through the basic commands and then shows you
how to combine them in simple patterns or idioms to provide
sophisticated functionality like histogramming.  This lecture assumes
you know what a shell is and that you have some basic familiarity with
UNIX.

</p><p> [By the way, this page gets a lot of attention on the net and
unfortunately I get mail from lots of people that have better
solutions or stuff I should add.  I'm only showing what I've learned
from watching good UNIX people so I am not saying these tips are the
optimal solutions.  I'd make a pretty ignorant sys admin.]
</p><h2>Everything is a stream</h2>


<p>The first thing you need to know is that UNIX is based upon the idea
of a <em>stream</em>.  Everything is a <em>stream</em>, or appears to be.  Device
drivers look like streams, terminals look like streams, processes
communicate via streams, etc...  The input and output of a program are
streams that you can redirect into a device, a file, or another
program.

</p><p>Here is an example device, the null device, that lets you throw
output away. For example, you might want to run a program but ignore
the output.
</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ls &gt; /dev/null # ignore output of ls
</pre></div>



<p>where "<tt># ignore output of ls</tt>" is a comment.

</p><p>Most of the commands covered in this lecture process <tt>stdin</tt> and send results to <tt>stdout</tt>.  In this manner, you can incrementally process a data stream by hooking the output of one tool to the input of another via a <em>pipe</em>.  For example, the following piped sequence prints the number of files in the current directory modified in August.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ls -l | grep Aug | wc -l
</pre></div>



<p>Imagine how long it would take you to write the equivalent C or Java
program. You can become an extremely productive UNIX programmer if you
learn to combine the simple command-line tools. Even when programming
on a PC, I use MKS's UNIX shell and command library to make it look
like a UNIX box. Worth the cash.
</p><h2>Getting help</h2>


<p>If you need to know about a command, ask for the "man" page.  For example, to find out about the <tt>ls</tt> command, type

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ man ls
LS(1)                   System General Commands Manual                   LS(1)

NAME
     ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ACFLRSTWacdfgiklnoqrstux1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
...
</pre></div>



<p>You will get a summary of the command and any arguments.

</p><p>If you cannot remember the command's name, try using <tt>apropos</tt> which finds commands and library routines related to that word.  For example, to find out how to do checksums, type

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ apropos checksum
cksum(1), sum(1)         - display file checksums and block counts
md5(1)                   - calculate a message-digest fingerprint (checksum) for a file
</pre></div>


<h2>Special Directories and files</h2>


<p>A shortcut for you home directory, <tt>/home/</tt><em>username</em>, is
<tt>~</tt><em>username</em>.  For example, <tt>~parrt</tt> is my home directory,
<tt>/home/parrt</tt>.

</p><p>When you are using the shell, there is the notion of <em>current
directory</em>.  The dot '<tt>.</tt>' character is a shorthand for the current
directory and '<tt>..</tt>' is a shorthand for the directory above the
current.  So to access file <tt>test</tt> in the current directory, <tt>./test</tt>
is the same as plain <tt>test</tt>.  If <tt>test</tt> is a directory above, use
<tt>../test</tt>.

</p><p><tt>/</tt> is the root directory; there is no drive specification in UNIX.

</p><p>The <tt>.bash_profile</tt> file is very important as it is how your shell
session is initialized including your ever-important <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
environment variable.  Your <tt>bash</tt> shell initialization file is
<tt>~</tt><em>username</em><tt>/.bash_profile</tt> and has set up code like the following:

</p><div class="code"><pre>PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
</pre></div>



<p>Typically, you will go in and set your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> so that you don't
have to set it all the time.

</p><div class="code"><pre>export CLASSPATH=".:/home/public/cs601/junit.jar"
</pre></div>



<p>The <tt>export</tt> means that the assignment to <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> is visible to
all child processes (that is, visible to all programs you run from the
shell).
</p><h2>The basics</h2>

<h3>cd</h3>


<p>Changing a directory is done with <tt>cd</tt> <em>dir</em> where <em>dir</em> can be "." or
".." to move to current directory (do nothing) or go up a directory.
</p><h3>ls</h3>


<p>Display files in a directory with <tt>ls</tt>.  The <tt>-l</tt> option is used to
display details of the files:

</p><div class="code"><pre>total 9592
-rw-r--r--    1 parrt  staff     5600 Aug 19  2005 C-Java-relationship.html
...
drwxr-xr-x   13 parrt  staff      442 Oct 19  2005 sessions
-rw-r--r--    1 parrt  staff     2488 Oct 19  2005 sessions.html
...
</pre></div>



<p>"staff" is parrt's group.

</p><p>If you want to see hidden files (those starting with "."), use "-a".

</p><p>Combinations are possible: use "ls -la" to see details of all files
including hidden ones.
</p><h3>displaying files</h3>


<p>There are 4 useful ways to display the contents or portions of a file.
The first is the very commonly used command <tt>cat</tt>.  For example, to
display my list of object-oriented keywords used in this course, type:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/oo.keywords.txt
</pre></div>



<p>If a file is really big, you will probably want to use <tt>more</tt>, which
spits the file out in screen-size chunks.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ more /var/log/mail.log
</pre></div>



<p>If you only want to see the first few lines of a file or the last few
lines use <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt>.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ head /var/log/mail.log
$ tail /var/log/mail.log
</pre></div>



<p>You can specify a number as an argument to get a specific number of lines:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ head -30 /var/log/mail.log
</pre></div>



<p>The most useful incantation of <tt>tail</tt> prints the last few lines of a
file and then waits, printing new lines as they are appended to the
file.  This is great for watching a log file:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ tail -f /var/log/mail.log
</pre></div>



<p>If you need to know how many characters, words, or lines are in a
file, use <tt>wc</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ wc /var/log/mail.log
     164    2916   37896 /var/log/mail.log
</pre></div>



<p>Where the numbers are, in order, lines, words, then characters.  For
clarity, you can use <tt>wc -l</tt> to print just the number of lines.
</p><h3>pushd, popd</h3>


<p>Instead of <tt>cd</tt> you can use <tt>pushd</tt> to save the current dir and then automatically <tt>cd</tt> to the specified directory.  For example, 

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ pwd
/Users/parrt
$ pushd /tmp
/tmp ~
$ pwd
/tmp
$ popd
~
$ pwd
/Users/parrt
</pre></div>


<h3>top</h3>


<p>To watch a dynamic display of the processes on your box in action, use <tt>top</tt>.
</p><h3>ps</h3>


<p>To print out (wide display) all processes running on a box, use <tt>ps auxwww</tt>.
</p><h3>chmod</h3>


<p>To change the privileges of a file or directory, use <tt>chmod</tt>.  The
privileges are 3 digit octal words with 3 bits per digit: rwxrwxrwx
where the first digit is for the file owner, the 2nd for the group,
and 3rd for anybody.  644 is a common word value file which means
110100100 or rw-r--r--.  When you do <tt>ls -l</tt> you will see these
bits. 755 is a common word value for directories: rwxr-xr-x where
directories need to be executable for <tt>cd</tt> to be able to enter that
dir. 755 is a shorthand for the more readable argument <tt>u=rwx,go=rx</tt>.
u is user, g is group, o is other.

</p><p>Use <tt>chmod -R</tt> for recursively applying to all the dirs below the
argument as well.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Searching streams</h2>


<p>One of the most useful tools available on UNIX and the one you may use the most is <tt>grep</tt>.  This tool matches regular expressions (which includes simple words) and prints matching lines to <tt>stdout</tt>.

</p><p>The simplest incantation looks for a particular character
sequence in a set of files. Here is an example that looks for any
reference to <tt>System</tt> in the java files in the current directory.

</p><div class="code"><pre>grep System *.java
</pre></div>



<p>You may find the dot '.' regular expression useful.  It matches any
single character but is typically combined with the star, which
matches zero or more of the preceding item.  Be careful to enclose the
expression in single quotes so the command-line expansion doesn't
modify the argument.  The following example, looks for references to
any a forum page in a server log file:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ grep '/forum/.*' /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log
</pre></div>



<p>or equivalently:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep '/forum/.*' 
</pre></div>



<p>The second form is useful when you want to process a collection of files as a single stream as in:

</p><div class="code"><pre>cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access*.log | grep '/forum/.*'
</pre></div>



<p>If you need to look for a string at the beginning of a line, use caret '^':

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ grep '^195.77.105.200' /home/public/cs601/unix/access*.log
</pre></div>



<p>This finds all lines in all access logs that begin with IP address
195.77.105.200.

</p><p>If you would like to invert the pattern matching to find lines that do not match a pattern, use <tt>-v</tt>.  Here is an example that finds references to non image <tt>GET</tt>s in a log file:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep -v '/images'
</pre></div>



<p>Now imagine that you have an http log file and you would like to
filter out page requests made by nonhuman spiders. If you have a file
called <tt>spider.IPs</tt>, you can find all nonspider page views via:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs
</pre></div>



<p>Finally, to ignore the case of the input stream, use <tt>-i</tt>.
</p><h2>Translating streams</h2>


<p>Morphing a text stream is a fundamental UNIX operation. PERL is a
good tool for this, but since I don't like PERL I stick with three
tools: <tt>tr</tt>, <tt>sed</tt>, and <tt>awk</tt>. PERL and these
tools are line-by-line tools in that they operate well only on patterns
fully contained within a single line. If you need to process more
complicated patterns like XML or you need to parse a programming
language, use a context-free grammar tool like <a href="http://www.antlr.org/"><b> ANTLR</b></a>.
</p><h3>tr</h3>


<p>For manipulating whitespace, you will find <tt>tr</tt> very useful.

</p><p>If you have columns of data separated by spaces and you would
like the columns to collapse so there is a single column of data, tell <tt>tr</tt> to replace space with newline <tt>tr ' ' '\n'</tt>.  Consider input file <tt>/home/public/cs601/unix/names</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>jim scott mike
bill randy tom
</pre></div>



<p>To get all those names in a column, use

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/names | tr ' ' '\n'
</pre></div>



<p>If you would like to collapse all sequences of spaces into one single space, use <tt>tr -s ' '</tt>.

</p><p>To convert a PC file to UNIX, you have to get rid of the '\r' characters.  Use <tt>tr -d '\r'</tt>.
</p><h3>sed</h3>


<p>If dropping or translating single characters is not enough, you can
use <tt>sed</tt> (stream editor) to replace or delete text chunks matched by
regular expressions.  For example, to delete all references to word
<tt>scott</tt> in the names file from above, use

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/names | sed 's/scott//'
</pre></div>



<p>which substitutes <tt>scott</tt> for nothing.  If there are multiple references to <tt>scott</tt> on a single line, use the <tt>g</tt> suffix to indicate "global" on that line otherwise only the first occurrence will be removed:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ... | sed 's/scott//g'
</pre></div>



<p>If you would like to replace references to <tt>view.jsp</tt> with <tt>index.jsp</tt>, use

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ... | sed 's/view.jsp/index.jsp/'
</pre></div>



<p>If you want any <tt>.asp</tt> file converted to <tt>.jsp</tt>, you must match the file name with a regular expression and refer to it via <tt>\1</tt>:
 

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ... | sed 's/\(.*\).asp/\1.jsp/'
</pre></div>



<p>The <tt>\(...\)</tt> grouping collects text that you can refer to with <tt>\1</tt>.

</p><p>If you want to kill everything from the ',' character to end of line, use the end-of-line marker <tt>$</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ... | sed 's/,.*$//' # kill from comma to end of line
</pre></div>


<h3>awk</h3>


<p>When you need to work with columns of data or execute a little bit of code for each line matching a pattern, use <tt>awk</tt>.  <tt>awk</tt> programs are pattern-action pairs.  While some <tt>awk</tt>
programs are complicated enough to require a separate file containing
the program, you can do some amazing things using an argument on the
command-line.
</p><p><tt>awk</tt> thinks input lines are broken up into fields (i.e., columns) separate by whitespace.  Fields are referenced in an action via <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, ... while <tt>$0</tt> refers to the entire input line.

</p><p>A pattern-action pair looks like:

</p><div class="code"><pre>pattern {action}
</pre></div>



<p>If you omit the pattern, the action is executed for each input line.
Omitting the action means print the line. You can separate the pairs by
newline or semicolon.
</p><p>Consider input

</p><div class="code"><pre>aasghar Asghar, Ali
wchen   Chen, Wei
zchen   Chen, Zhen-Jian
</pre></div>



<p>If you want a list of login names, ask <tt>awk</tt> to print the first column:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{print $1;}'
</pre></div>

 

<p>If you want to convert the login names to email addresses, use the <tt>printf</tt> C-lookalike function:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{printf("%s@cs.usfca.edu,",$1);}'
</pre></div>



<p>Because of the missing <tt>\n</tt> in the <tt>printf</tt> string, you'll see the output all on one line ready for pasting into a mail program: 

</p><div class="code"><pre>aasghar@cs.usfca.edu,wchen@cs.usfca.edu,zchen@cs.usfca.edu
</pre></div>



<p>You might also want to reorder columns of data.  To print firstname, lastname, you might try:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{printf("%s %s\n", $3, $2);}'
</pre></div>



<p>but you'll notice that the comma is still there as it is part of the column:

</p><div class="code"><pre>Ali Asghar,
Wei Chen,
Zhen-Jian Chen,
</pre></div>



<p>You need to pipe the output thru <tt>tr</tt> (or <tt>sed</tt>) to strip the comma:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | \
  awk '{printf("%s %s\n", $3, $2);}' | \
  tr -d ','
</pre></div>



<p>Then you will see:

</p><div class="code"><pre>Ali Asghar
Wei Chen
Zhen-Jian Chen
</pre></div>



<p>You can also use <tt>awk</tt> to examine the value of content.  To sum up the first column of the following data (in file <tt>/home/public/cs601/unix/coffee</tt>):

</p><div class="code"><pre>3 parrt
2 jcoker
8 tombu
</pre></div>



<p>use the following simple command:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{n+=$1;} ; END {print n;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/coffee
</pre></div>



<p>where <tt>END</tt> is a special pattern that means "after processing the stream."

</p><p>If you want to filter or sum all values less than or equal to, say 3, use an <tt>if</tt> statement:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{if ($1&lt;=3) n+=$1;} END {print n;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/coffee
</pre></div>



<p>In this case, you will see output <tt>5</tt> (3+2);

</p><p>Using <tt>awk</tt> to grab a particular column is very common when processing log files.  Consider a <a href="http://www.jguru.com/"><b>http://www.jguru.com</b></a> page view log file, <tt>/home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log</tt>, that are of the form:

</p><div class="code"><pre>date-stamp(thread-name): userID-or-IPaddr URL site-section
</pre></div>



<p>So, the data looks like this:

</p><div class="code"><pre>20021022_00.00.04(tcpConnection-80-3019):       203.6.152.30    /faq/subtopic.jsp?topicID=472&amp;page=2    FAQs

...
</pre></div>



<p>When a user is logged in, the log file has their user ID rather than their IP address.

</p><p>Here is how you get a list of URLs that people view on say October 22, 2002:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log
/faq/subtopic.jsp?topicID=472&amp;page=2
/index.jsp
/faq/subtopic.jsp?topicID=364
/faq/view.jsp?EID=736437
/faq/topicindex.jsp?topic=JSP
/faq/index.jsp
/faq/view.jsp?EID=225150
/forums/most_active.jsp?topic=EJB
/guru/edit_account.jsp
/misc/login.jsp
...
</pre></div>



<p>If you want to count how many page views there were that day that
were not processing pages (my processing pages are all of the form <tt>process_</tt><em>xxx</em>), pipe the results through <tt>grep</tt> and <tt>wc</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  grep -v process | \
  wc -l
67850
</pre></div>



<p>If you want a unique list of URLs, you can sort the output and then use <tt>uniq</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq
</pre></div>



<p><tt>uniq</tt> just collapses all repeated lines into a single line--that is why you must sort the output first.  You'll get output like:

</p><div class="code"><pre>/article/index.jsp
/article/index.jsp?page=1
/article/index.jsp?page=10
/article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</pre></div>


<h2>Tarballs</h2>


<p>Note: <em>The name comes from a similar word, hairball (stuff that cats throw up), I'm pretty sure</em>.

</p><p>To collect a bunch of files and directories together, use <tt>tar</tt>.  For example, to tar up your entire home directory and put the tarball into <tt>/tmp</tt>, do this

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cd ~parrt
$ cd .. # go one dir above dir you want to tar
$ tar cvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar parrt
</pre></div>



<p>By convention, use <tt>.tar</tt> as the extension.  To untar this file use

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cd /tmp
$ tar xvf parrt.backup.tar
</pre></div>



<p><tt>tar</tt> untars things in the <b>current</b> directory!

</p><p>After running the untar, you will find a new directory, <tt>/tmp/parrt</tt>,
that is a copy of your home directory. Note that the way you tar things
up dictates the directory structure when untarred. The fact that I
mentioned <tt>parrt</tt> in the tar creation means that I'll have that
dir when untarred. In contrast, the following will also make a copy of
my home directory, but without having a <tt>parrt</tt> root dir:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cd ~parrt
$ tar cvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar *
</pre></div>



<p>It is a good idea to tar things up with a root directory so that
when you untar you don't generate a million files in the current
directly. To see what's in a tarball, use
</p><div class="code"><pre>$ tar tvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar
</pre></div>



<p>Most of the time you can save space by using the <tt>z</tt> argument.  The tarball will then be <tt>gzip</tt>'d and you should use file extension <tt>.tar.gz</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cd ~parrt
$ cd .. # go one dir above dir you want to tar
$ tar cvfz /tmp/parrt.backup.tar.gz parrt
</pre></div>



<p>Unzipping requires the <tt>z</tt> argument also:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ cd /tmp
$ tar xvfz parrt.backup.tar.gz
</pre></div>



<p>If you have a big file to compress, use <tt>gzip</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ gzip bigfile
</pre></div>



<p>After execution, your file will have been renamed <tt>bigfile.gz</tt>.  To uncompress, use 

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ gzip -d bigfile.gz
</pre></div>



<p>To display a text file that is currently <tt>gzip</tt>'d, use <tt>zcat</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ zcat bigfile.gz
</pre></div>


<h2>Moving files between machines</h2>

<h3>rsync</h3>


<p>When you need to have a directory on one machine mirrored on another machine, use <tt>rsync</tt>.
It compares all the files in a directory subtree and copies over any
that have changed to the mirrored directory on the other machine. For
example, here is how you could "pull" all logs files from <tt>livebox.jguru.com</tt> to the box from which you execute the <tt>rsync</tt> command:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ hostname
jazz.jguru.com
$ rsync -rabz -e ssh -v 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' \
  /backup/web/logs
</pre></div>



<p><tt>rsync</tt> will delete or truncate files to ensure the files
stay the same. This is bad if you erase a file by mistake--it will wipe
out your backup file. Add an argument called <tt>--suffix</tt> to tell <tt>rsync</tt> to make a copy of any existing file before it overwrites it:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ hostname
jazz.jguru.com
$ rsync -rabz -e ssh -v --suffix .rsync_`date '+%Y%m%d'` \
 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' /backup/web/logs
</pre></div>



<p>where <tt>`date '+%Y%m%d'`</tt> (in reverse single quotes) means "execute this <tt>date</tt> command".

</p><p>To exclude certain patterns from the sync, use <tt>--exclude</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ rsync -rabz --exclude=entitymanager/ --suffix .rsync_`date '+%Y%m%d'` \
  -e ssh -v 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' /backup/web/logs
</pre></div>


<h3>scp</h3>


<p>To copy a file or directory manually, use <tt>scp</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ scp lecture.html parrt@nexus.cs.usfca.edu:~parrt/lectures
</pre></div>



<p>Just like <tt>cp</tt>, use <tt>-r</tt> to copy a directory recursively.
</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>find</h3>


<p>Most GUIs for Linux or PCs have a search facility, but from the command-line you can use <tt>find</tt>.  To find all files named <tt>.p4</tt> starting in directory <tt>~/antlr/depot/projects</tt>, use:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ find  ~/antlr/depot/projects -name '.p4'
</pre></div>



<p>The default "action" is to <tt>-print</tt>.

</p><p>You can specify a regular expression to match.  For example, to look under your home directory for any xml files, use:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ find ~ -name '*.xml' -print
</pre></div>



<p>Note the use of the single quotes to prevent command-line expansion--you want the '*' to go to the <tt>find</tt> command.

</p><p>You can execute a command for every file or directory found that matches a name.  For example, do delete all xml files, do this:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ find ~ -name '*.xml' -exec rm {} \;
</pre></div>



<p>where "{}" stands for "current file that matches". The end of the
command must be terminated with ';' but because of the command-line
expansion, you'll need to escape the ';'.
</p><p>You can also specify time information in your query.  Here is a shell script that uses <tt>find</tt> to delete all files older than 14 days.

</p><div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/sh

BACKUP_DIR=/var/data/backup

# number of days to keep backups
AGE=14 # days
AGE_MINS=$[ $AGE * 60 * 24 ]

# delete dirs/files
find $BACKUP_DIR/* -cmin +$AGE_MINS -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
</pre></div>


<h3>fuser</h3>


<p>If you want to know who is using a port such as HTTP (80), use <tt>fuser</tt>.  You must be root to use this:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ sudo /sbin/fuser -n tcp 80
80/tcp:              13476 13477 13478 13479 13480
13481 13482 13483 13484 13486 13487 13489 13490 13491
13492 13493 13495 13496 13497 13498 13499 13500 13501 13608
</pre></div>



<p>The output indicates the list of processes associated with that port.
</p><h3>whereis</h3>


<p>Sometimes you want to use a command but it's not in your <tt>PATH</tt> and you can't remember where it is.  Use <tt>whereis</tt> to look in standard unix locations for the command.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ whereis fuser
fuser: /sbin/fuser /usr/man/man1/fuser.1 /usr/man/man1/fuser.1.gz
$ whereis ls   
ls: /bin/ls /usr/man/man1/ls.1 /usr/man/man1/ls.1.gz
</pre></div>



<p><tt>whereis</tt> also shows <tt>man</tt> pages.
</p><h3>which</h3>


<p>Sometimes you might be executing the wrong version of a command and you want to know which version of the command your <tt>PATH</tt> indicates should be run. Use <tt>which</tt> to ask:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ which ls
alias ls='ls --color=tty'
        /bin/ls
$ which java
/usr/local/java/bin/java
</pre></div>



<p>If nothing is found in your path, you'll see:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ which fuser
/usr/bin/which: no fuser in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/java/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/parrt/bin)
</pre></div>


<h3>kill</h3>


<p>To send a signal to a process, use <tt>kill</tt>.  Typically you'll want to just say <tt>kill pid</tt> where <tt>pid</tt> can be found from <tt>ps</tt> or <tt>top</tt> (see below).

</p><p>Use <tt>kill -9 pid</tt> when you can't get the process to die; this means kill it with "extreme prejudice".
</p><h3>traceroute</h3>


<p>If you are having trouble getting to a site, use <tt>traceroute</tt> to watch the sequence of hops used to get to a site:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ /usr/sbin/traceroute www.cnn.com
 1  65.219.20.145 (65.219.20.145)  2.348 ms  1.87 ms  1.814 ms
 2  loopback0.gw5.sfo4.alter.net (137.39.11.23)  3.667 ms  3.741 ms  3.695 ms
 3  160.atm3-0.xr1.sfo4.alter.net (152.63.51.190)  3.855 ms  3.825 ms  3.993 ms
...
</pre></div>


<h3>What is my IP address?</h3>


<div class="code"><pre>$ /sbin/ifconfig
</pre></div>



<p>Under the <tt>eth0</tt> interface, you'll see the <tt>inet addr</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:10:DC:58:B1:F0  
          inet addr:138.202.170.4  Bcast:138.202.170.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          ...
</pre></div>


<h2>Useful combinations</h2>

<h3>How to kill a set of processes</h3>


<p>If you want to kill all <tt>java</tt> processes running for <tt>parrt</tt>, you can
either run <tt>killall java</tt> if you are <tt>parrt</tt> or generate a "kill"
script via:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ps auxwww|grep java|grep parrt|awk '{print "kill -9 ",$2;}' &gt; /tmp/killparrt
$ bash /tmp/killparrt # run resulting script
</pre></div>



<p>The <tt>/tmp/killparrt</tt> file would look something like:

</p><div class="code"><pre>kill -9 1021
kill -9 1023
kill -9 1024
</pre></div>



<p>Note: you can also do this common task with:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ killall java
</pre></div>



<p>Please be aware that this is linux specific; i'm told that it will kill all processing on UNIXen like Solaris!
</p><h3>How to make a histogram</h3>


<p>A histogram is set of count, value pairs indicating how often the
value occurs. The basic operation will be to sort, then count how many
values occur in a row and then reverse sort so that the value with the
highest count is at the top of the report.
</p><div class="code"><pre>$ ... | sort |uniq -c|sort -r -n 
</pre></div>



<p>Note that <tt>sort</tt> sorts on the whole line, but the first
column is obviously significant just as the first letter in someone's
last name significantly positions their name in a sorted list.
</p><p><tt>uniq -c</tt> collapses all repeated sequences of values but
prints the number of occurrences in front of the value. Recall the
previous sorting:
</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq
/article/index.jsp
/article/index.jsp?page=1
/article/index.jsp?page=10
/article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</pre></div>



<p>Now add <tt>-c</tt> to <tt>uniq</tt>:

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c
 623 /article/index.jsp
   6 /article/index.jsp?page=1
  10 /article/index.jsp?page=10
 109 /article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</pre></div>



<p>Now all you have to do is reverse sort the lines according to the first column numerically.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n
6170 /index.jsp
2916 /search/results.jsp
1397 /faq/index.jsp
1018 /forums/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
...
</pre></div>



<p>In practice, you might want to get a histogram that has been
"despidered" and only has faq related views. You can filter out all
page view lines associated with spider IPs and filter in only faq
lines:
</p><div class="code"><pre>$ grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  awk '{print $3;}'| \
  grep '/faq' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n
1397 /faq/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
 525 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Struts
 501 /faq/home.jsp?topic=JSP
 423 /faq/home.jsp?topic=EJB
...
</pre></div>



<p>If you want to only see despidered faq pages that were referenced more than 500 times, add an <tt>awk</tt> command to the end.

</p><div class="code"><pre>$ grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  awk '{print $3;}'| \
  grep '/faq' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n | \
  awk '{if ($1&gt;500) print $0;}'
1397 /faq/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
 525 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Struts
 501 /faq/home.jsp?topic=JSP
</pre></div>


<h3>Generating Java class hierarchy diagrams</h3>


<p>A student asked if I knew of a program that generated class hierarchy
diagrams.  I said "no", but then realized we don't need one.  Here's
the one liner to do it:

</p><div class="code"><pre># pulls out superclass and class as $5 and $3:
# public class A extends B ...
# only works for public classes and usual formatting
cat *.java | grep 'public class' $1 | \
    awk 'BEGIN {print "digraph foo {";} {print $5 "-&gt;" $3;} END {print "}"}'
</pre></div>



<p>It generates <a href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/%7Eparrt/course/601/lectures/www.graphviz.org"><b>DOT</b></a> format graph files.  Try it.
It's amazing.  Works for most cases.  Output looks like:

</p><div class="code"><pre>digraph foo {
antlr.CharScanner-&gt;JavaLexer
antlr.LLkParser-&gt;Mantra
-&gt;TestLexer
}
</pre></div>


<h3>Generating scripts and programs</h3>


<p>I like to automate as much as possible.  Sometimes that means writing a program that generates another program or script.
</p><h4>Processing mail files</h4>


<p>I wanted to get a sequence of SQL commands that would update our
database whenever someone's email bounced. Processing the mail file is
pretty easy since you can look for the error code followed by the email
address. A bounced email looks like:
</p><div class="code"><pre>From MAILER-DAEMON@localhost.localdomain  Wed Jan  9 17:32:33 2002
Return-Path: &lt;&gt;

This is a MIME-encapsulated message

--g0A1W2o02285.1010626322/web.jguru.com

The original message was received at Wed, 9 Jan 2002 17:32:02 -0800
from localhost [127.0.0.1]

   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
&lt;pain@intheneck.com&gt;
    (reason: 550 Host unknown)

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
550 5.1.2 &lt;pain@intheneck.com&gt;... Host unknown (Name server: intheneck.com: host not found)
...
</pre></div>



<p>Notice the SMTP 550 error message.  Look for that at the start of a line then kill the angle brackets, remove the <tt>...</tt> and use <tt>awk</tt> to print out the SQL:

</p><div class="code"><pre># This script works on one email or a file full of other emails
# since it just looks for the SMTP 550 or 554 results and then
# converts them to SQL commands.
grep -E '^(550|554)' | \
        sed 's/[&lt;&gt;]//g' | \
        sed 's/\.\.\.//' | \
        awk "{printf(\"UPDATE PERSON SET bounce=1 WHERE email='%s';\n\",\$3);}" &gt;&gt; bounces.sql
</pre></div>



<p>I have to escape the <tt>$3</tt> because it means something to the surround bash shell script and I want <tt>awk</tt> to see the dollar sign.
