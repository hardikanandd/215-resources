<p><font color=red><b>Uploading Files</b></font><br><br>

The following is a set of instructions on how to upload files using the digital drop box.<br>

<ol>
<li>Go to the dropbox site at https://dropbox.cse.sc.edu.</li> 
<li>Log in using the same username and password that you use in lab.</li>
<li>Once you are in the main page, you will see all CSCE courses you are currently registered for.
Click on the name of the relevent class.</li>
<li>Click on the name of the assignment you wish to upload, then click on "Add file".</li>
<li>You will get a screen that has three boxes with a "Browse" button located next to each. Pay attention to the notes on that page pertaining to file naming conventions and uploading limits.</li>
<li>Press the "Browse" button. You will get one of two windows: "Choose File" or "Browse".
Click on the file to be uploaded. Make sure you see the complete file path in the "File Name" box at the bottom of the window. Press "OK".</li>
<li>Now you should see the path to the file you uploaded in the appropriate box on the upload page. DO NOT alter the file path manually. This will result in uploading an empty file.</li>
<li>Press "Upload Files" followed by "Done".</li>
<li>Now you should see the files you under the "Drop Box Contents" section. If you have uploaded the wrong file or an old version of it, press "Delete" to remove it from your drop box.</li>
</ol>

<p><font color=red><b>How to Display Web Pages Using Your USC Web Space</b></font><br><br>

The USC server will automatically display your webpage if you organize your home directory properly.<br />

<ol>
<li>Move all your HTML pages (.html extension) in addition to all images you used to your public_html folder. To do this open your home folder. You will see a folder icon named public_html. Drag and drop the desired files onto the public_html folder icon.</li>  

<li>Open the public_html folder (double click on it) from the home folder window. If you have not already saved your main page as index.html, you will see that there is a default index.html file there, delete it (right-click, choose put in trash). Now click on the icon of your main page once and click on the name part to get a cursor in the name. Change the file name to index.html.</li>

<li>index.html is the first (or main) page that others will see when they type in your URL. In order for them to see your other pages, you MUST provide links on the first page to the other pages. In other words, you should have hyper links to each of the other pages.</li> 

<li>Next, you should check your URL to make sure that everything can be viewed OK. Your USC network URL is cse.sc.edu/~username. Make sure you put your own username there.</li> 

<li>If any of the images that used to show up before is not showing now, you must check three things:

<ul>
<li>Go to the public_html folder and make sure that the image file is there.</li>
<li>If the image is there, right-click on it, select "Properties". You should have the Read attribute checked for Owner, Group, and Other.</li>
<li>Go back and check Reload (Refresh) your page and see if the images show.</li> 
</ul>
</ol>

<p><font color=red><b>Converting File Types</b></font><br><br>
<ol>
<li>To do this, you simply open the file to be converted.</li>
<li>Click Save As. When the Save window opens, leave the file name as is and select the desired file type you want to convert to.</li>
<li>Example: If you want to convert a MS Word document (.doc extension) to PDF, open the Word document, click Save As, and choose PDF for the file type. This will create a copy of your original Word document in PDF format.</li>  
</ol>

<p><font color=red><b>Terminating a Frozen Application</b></font>

<br><br>

<ol>
<li>From your desktop, click on the arrow above the icon that resembles two colored columns. Click on "This Host".</li>
<li>Type the following at the command prompt: ps -Uusername. Enter your own username in place of "username" in this command.</li>
<li>You will see the list of processes you are currently running on your machine. Observe the PID of the application you want to terminate.</li>
<li>Type at the following at the command prompt: kill -9 PID. The PID in this command is the PID number you observed for the application you want to kill.</li>
<li>Now you may start the application.</li>
<li>Alternatively, from the toolbar on your main desktop click on the arrow above the fourth icon from the right. Click on Find Process. In the window opened you will see a box called Filter. Type in your username in the Filter box. This will display the process you are running. Find the frozen process by looking under the Name column. Click on it, then right click, and select kill. This should terminate the process.</li>
