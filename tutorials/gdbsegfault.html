<h1>
7.2 Example Debugging Session: Segmentation Fault Example
</h1>



<p>
We are going to use gdb to figure out why the following program causes
a segmentation fault. The program is meant to read in a line of text
from the user and print it. However, we will see that in it's current
state it doesn't work as expected...
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>1 : #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
2 : #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

3 : int main(int argc, char **argv)
4 : {
5 :   char *buf;
6 :
7 :   buf = malloc(1&lt;&lt;31);
8 :
9 :   fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);
10:   printf("%s\n", buf);
11:
12:   return 1;
13: }
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<hr>

<p>
The first step is to compile the program with debugging flags:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>prompt&gt; gcc -g segfault.c
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
Now we run the program:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>prompt &gt; a.out
Hello World!
Segmentation fault
prompt &gt; 
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
This is not what we want. Time to fire up gdb:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>prompt &gt; gdb a.out

(gdb) 
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
We'll just run it and see what happens:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/dgawd/cpsc/363/a.out 
test string

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x4007fc13 in _IO_getline_info () from /lib/libc.so.6
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
So we received the SIGSEGV signal from the operating system. This means
that we tried to access an invalid memory address. Let's take a backtrace:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x4007fc13 in _IO_getline_info () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x4007fb6c in _IO_getline () from /lib/libc.so.6
#2  0x4007ef51 in fgets () from /lib/libc.so.6
#3  0x80484b2 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffffaf4) at segfault.c:10
#4  0x40037f5c in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
We are only interested in our own code here, so we want to switch to
stack frame 3 and see where the program crashed:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) frame 3
#3  0x80484b2 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffffaf4) at segfault.c:10
10        fgets(buf, 1024, stdin)
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
We crashed inside the call to fgets. In general, we can assume that 
library functions such as fgets work properly (if this isn't the
case, we are in a lot of trouble). So the problem must be one
of our arguments. You may not know that 'stdin' is a global
variable that is created by the stdio libraries. So we can assume
this one is ok. That leaves us with 'buf':
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) print buf
$1 = 0x0
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
The value of buf is 0x0, which is the NULL pointer. This is not what
we want - buf should point to the memory we allocated on line 8. So
we're going to have to find out what happened there. First we want to
kill the currently-running invocation of our program:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) kill
Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
Now set a breakpoint on line 8:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) break segfault.c:8
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048486: file segfault.c, line 8.
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
Now run the program again:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/dgawd/cpsc/363/a.out 

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xbffffaf4) at segfault.c:8
8         buf = malloc(1&lt;&lt;31);
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
We're going to check the value of buf before the malloc call. Since
buf wasn't initialized, the value should be garbage, and it is:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) print buf
$2 = 0xbffffaa8 "Èúÿ¿#\177\003@t`\001@\001"
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
Now step over the malloc call and examine buf again:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>(gdb) next
10        fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);
(gdb) print buf
$3 = 0x0
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
After the call to malloc, buf is NULL. If you were to go check the
man page for malloc, you would discover that malloc returns NULL
when it cannot allocate the amount of memory requested. So our
malloc must have failed. Let's go back and look at it again:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>7 :   buf = malloc(1&lt;&lt;31);
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
Well, the value of the expression 1 &lt;&lt; 31 (the integer 1 right-shifted
31 times) is 429497295, or 4GB (gigabytes). Very few machines have
this kind of memory - mine only has 256MB. So of cousre malloc would fail.
Furthermore, we are only reading in 1024 bytes in the fgets call. All
that extra space would be wasted, even if we could allocate it. Change
the 1&lt;&lt;31 to 1024 (or 1&lt;&lt;9), and the program will work as expected:
</p>

<blockquote><p><code></code></p><pre>prompt &gt;
Hello World!
Hello World!

prompt &gt;
</pre></blockquote><p></p>

<p>
So now you know how to debug segmentation faults with gdb. This is
extremely useful (I use it more often then I care to admit). The 
example also illustrated another very important point: ALWAYS
CHECK THE RETURN VALUE OF MALLOC! Have a nice day.
