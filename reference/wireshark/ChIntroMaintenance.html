      Wireshark was initially developed by Gerald Combs. Ongoing development
      and maintenance of Wireshark is handled by the Wireshark team, a loose
      group of individuals who fix bugs and provide new functionality.
    </p><p>
      There have also been a large number of people who have contributed
      protocol dissectors to Wireshark, and it is expected that this will
      continue.  You can find a list of the people who have contributed
      code to Wireshark by checking the about dialog box of Wireshark, or at
	  the <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/about.html" target="_top">authors</a> page on the
      Wireshark web site.
    </p><p>
      Wireshark is an open source software project, and is released under
      the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU General Public Licence</a> (GPL).
	  All source code is freely available under the GPL.  You are welcome to
      modify Wireshark to suit your own needs, and it would be appreciated
      if you contribute your improvements back to the Wireshark team.
    </p><p>
      You gain three benefits by contributing your improvements back to the
      community:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	    Other people who find your contributions useful will appreciate
	    them, and you will know that you have helped people in the
	    same way that the developers of Wireshark have helped people.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    The developers of Wireshark might improve your changes even more,
		as there's always room for improvement. Or they may implement some
		advanced things on top of your code, which can be useful for yourself
		too.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    The maintainers and developers of Wireshark will maintain your
	    code as well, fixing it when API changes or other changes are
	    made, and generally keeping it in tune with what is happening
	    with Wireshark. So if Wireshark is updated (which is done often),
		you can get a new Wireshark version from the website and your changes
		will already be included without any effort for you.
