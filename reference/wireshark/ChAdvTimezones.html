    confusing. If you get a capture file from somewhere around the
    world time zones can even be a lot more confusing ;-)</p><p>First of all, there are two reasons why you may not need
    to think about time zones at all: 
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You are only interested in the time differences
        between the packet time stamps and don't need to know the
        exact date and time of the captured packets (which is often
        the case).</p></li><li><p>You don't get capture files from different time zones
        than your own, so there are simply no time zone problems.
        For example: everyone in your team is working in the same
        time zone as yourself.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>What are time zones?</b></p><p>People expect that the time reflects the sunset. Dawn
      should be in the morning maybe around 06:00 and dusk in the
      evening maybe at 20:00. These times will obviously vary
      depending on the season. It would be very confusing if
      everyone on earth would use the same global time as this
      would correspond to the sunset only at a small part of the
      world.</p><p>For that reason, the earth is split into several
      different time zones, each zone with a local time that
      corresponds to the local sunset.</p><p>The time zone's base time is UTC (Coordinated Universal
      Time) or Zulu Time (military and aviation). The older term
      GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) shouldn't be used as it is slightly
      incorrect (up to 0.9 seconds difference to UTC). The UTC base
      time equals to 0 (based at Greenwich, England) and all time
      zones have an offset to UTC between -12 to +14 hours!</p><p>For example: If you live in Berlin you are in a time
      zone one hour earlier than UTC, so you are in time zone "+1"
      (time difference in hours compared to UTC). If it's 3 o'clock
      in Berlin it's 2 o'clock in UTC "at the same moment".</p><p>Be aware that at a few places on earth don't use time
      zones with even hour offsets (e.g. New Delhi uses
      UTC+05:30)!</p><p>Further information can be found at:

      is intended to "save" some daylight during the summer months.
      To do this, a lot of countries (but not all!) add a DST hour
      to the already existing UTC offset. So you may need to take
      another hour (or in very rare cases even two hours!)
      difference into your "time zone calculations".</p><p>Unfortunately, the date at which DST actually takes
      effect is different throughout the world. You may also note,
      that the northern and southern hemispheres have opposite
      DST's (e.g. while it's summer in Europe it's winter in
      Australia).</p><p>Keep in mind: UTC remains the same all year around,
      regardless of DST!</p><p>Further information can be found at:

      zones anyway?</p><p>Wireshark's native capture file format (libpcap
      format), and some other capture file formats, such as the
      Windows Sniffer, EtherPeek, AiroPeek, and Sun snoop formats,
      save the arrival time of packets as UTC values. UN*X systems,
      and "Windows NT based" systems (Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000,
      Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista) represent
      time internally as UTC. When Wireshark is capturing, no
      conversion is necessary. However, if the system time zone is
      not set correctly, the system's UTC time might not be
      correctly set even if the system clock appears to display
      correct local time. "Windows 9x based" systems (Windows 95,
      Windows 98, Windows Me) represent time internally as local
      time. When capturing, WinPcap has to convert the time to UTC
      before supplying it to Wireshark. If the system's time zone
      is not set correctly, that conversion will not be done
      correctly.</p><p>Other capture file formats, such as the Microsoft
      Network Monitor, DOS-based Sniffer, and Network Instruments
      Observer formats, save the arrival time of packets as local
      time values.</p><p>Internally to Wireshark, time stamps are represented in
      UTC; this means that, when reading capture files that save
      the arrival time of packets as local time values, Wireshark
      must convert those local time values to UTC values.</p><p>Wireshark in turn will display the time stamps always
      in local time. The displaying computer will convert them from
      UTC to local time and displays this (local) time. For capture
      files saving the arrival time of packets as UTC values, this
      means that the arrival time will be displayed as the local
      time in your time zone, which might not be the same as the
      arrival time in the time zone in which the packet was
      captured. For capture files saving the arrival time of
      packets as local time values, the conversion to UTC will be
      done using your time zone's offset from UTC and DST rules,
      which means the conversion will not be done correctly; the
      conversion back to local time for display might undo this
      correctly, in which case the arrival time will be displayed
      as the arrival time in which the packet was captured.</p><p>

      </p><p>An example: Let's assume that someone in Los Angeles
      captured a packet with Wireshark at exactly 2 o'clock local
      time and sends you this capture file. The capture file's time
      stamp will be represented in UTC as 10 o'clock. You are
      located in Berlin and will see 11 o'clock on your Wireshark
      display.</p><p>Now you have a phone call, video conference or Internet
      meeting with that one to talk about that capture file. As you
      are both looking at the displayed time on your local
      computers, the one in Los Angeles still sees 2 o'clock but
      you in Berlin will see 11 o'clock. The time displays are
      different as both Wireshark displays will show the
      (different) local times at the same point in time.</p><p>
      <span><strong class="command">Conclusion</strong></span>: You may not bother about the
      date/time of the time stamp you currently look at, unless you
      must make sure that the date/time is as expected. So, if you
      get a capture file from a different time zone and/or DST,
      you'll have to find out the time zone/DST difference between
      the two local times and "mentally adjust" the time stamps
      accordingly. In any case, make sure that every computer in
      question has the correct time and time zone setting.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ChAdvTimestamps.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ChapterAdvanced.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ChAdvReassemblySection.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">7.4. Time Stamps </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7.6. Packet Reassembling</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
