    address values into a human readable format. There are two
    possible ways to do these conversations, depending on the
    resolution to be done: calling system/network services (like
    the gethostname function) and/or evaluate from Wireshark
    specific configuration files. For details about the
    configuration files Wireshark uses for name resolution and
    alike, see 
    <a href="AppFiles.html" title="Appendix A. Files and Folders">Appendix A, <i>Files and Folders</i></a>.</p><p>The name resolution feature can be en-/disabled

          files.</p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">The resolved names are not stored in the capture
          file or somewhere else.</strong></span> So the resolved names
          might not be available if you open the capture file later
          or on a different machine. Each time you open a capture
          file it may look "slightly different", maybe simply
          because you can't connect to a name server (which you
          could connect before).</p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">DNS may add additional packets to your capture
          file.</strong></span> You may see packets to/from your machine
          in your capture file, which are caused by name resolution
          network services of the machine Wireshark captures from.
          XXX - are there any other such packets than DNS
          ones?</p></li><li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">Resolved DNS names are cached by

          performance. However, if the name resolution information
          should change while Wireshark is running, Wireshark won't
          notice a change to the name resolution information once
          it gets cached. If this information changes while
          Wireshark is running, e.g. a new DHCP lease takes effect,
          Wireshark won't notice it. XXX - is this true for all or
          only for DNS info?</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip: Tip!"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="wsug_graphics/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip!</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The name resolution in the packet list is done while

      <span><strong class="command">DNS/ADNS name resolution (system/library

      associated with it (e.g. 216.239.37.99 -&gt;
      www.1.google.com). The DNS service is using synchronous calls
      to the DNS server. So Wireshark will stop responding until a
      response to a DNS request is returned. If possible, you might
      consider using the ADNS library (which won't wait for a
      network response).</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning: Warning!"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="wsug_graphics/warning.png"></td><th align="left">Warning!</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Enabling network name resolution when your name

      <span><strong class="command">DNS vs. ADNS</strong></span>: here's a short comparison:
      Both mechanisms are used to convert an IP address to some
      human readable (domain) name. The usual DNS call
      gethostname() will try to convert the address to a name. To
      do this, it will first ask the systems hosts file (e.g.
      /etc/hosts) if it finds a matching entry. If that fails, it
      will ask the configured DNS server(s) about the name.</p><p>So the real difference between DNS and ADNS comes when
      the system has to wait for the DNS server about a name
      resolution. The system call gethostname() will wait until a
      name is resolved or an error occurs. If the DNS server is
      unavailable, this might take quite a while (several seconds).
      The ADNS service will work a bit differently. It will also
      ask the DNS server, but it won't wait for the answer. It will
      just return to Wireshark in a very short amount of time. The
      actual (and the following) address fields won't show the
      resolved name until the ADNS call returned. As mentioned
      above, the values get cached, so you can use View/Reload to
      "update" these fields to show the resolved values.</p><p>
      <span><strong class="command">hosts name resolution (hosts file)</strong></span>: If DNS
      name resolution failed, Wireshark will try to convert an IP
      address to the hostname associated with it, using a hosts
      file provided by the user (e.g. 216.239.37.99 -&gt;
      www.google.com).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4769668"></a>7.7.4. IPX name resolution (network layer)</h3></div></div></div><p>
