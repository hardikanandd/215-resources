	We will examine each of the command line options in turn.
    </p><p>
      The first thing to notice is that issuing the command
      <span><strong class="command">wireshark</strong></span> by itself will bring up
      <span class="application">Wireshark</span>.
      However, you can include as many of the command line parameters as
      you like. Their meanings are as follows ( in alphabetical order ):
	  XXX - is the alphabetical order a good choice? Maybe better task based?
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    	Specify a criterion that specifies when Wireshark is to stop writing
		to a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value, where test
		is one of:
		</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">duration</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Stop writing to a capture file after value of seconds have elapsed.
			</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">filesize</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of value
			kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, not 1024 bytes). If
			this option is used together with the -b option, Wireshark will
			stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next
			one if filesize is reached.
			</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">files</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Stop writing to capture files after value number of files were
			written.
			</p></dd></dl></div><p>
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
		If a maximum capture file size was specified, this option causes Wireshark to run
		in "ring buffer" mode, with the specified number of files. In "ring
		buffer" mode, Wireshark will write to several capture files. Their
		name is based on the number of the file and on the creation date and
		time.
	    </p><p>
		When the first capture file fills up, Wireshark will switch to writing
		to the next file, until it fills up the last file, at which point
		it'll discard the data in the first file (unless 0 is specified, in
		which case, the number of files is unlimited) and start writing to
		that file and so on.
	    </p><p>
		If the optional duration is specified, Wireshark will also switch to
		the next file when the specified number of seconds has elapsed even
		if the current file is not completely fills up.
	    </p><p>
		</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">duration</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Switch to the next file after value seconds have elapsed, even
			if the current file is not completely filled up.
			</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">filesize</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Switch to the next file after it reaches a size of value kilobytes
			(where a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, not 1024 bytes).
			</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">files</strong></span>:value</span></dt><dd><p>
			Begin again with the first file after value number of files were
			written (form a ring buffer).
			</p></dd></dl></div><p>
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-B &lt;capture buffer size (Win32 only)&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      Win32 only: set capture buffer size (in MB, default is 1MB). This
		  is used by the the capture driver to buffer packet data until that
		  data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while
		  capturing, try to increase this size.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-c &lt;capture packet count&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      This option specifies the maximum number of packets to capture
	      when capturing live data.  It would be used in conjunction
	      with the <span><strong class="command">-k</strong></span> option.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-D</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
Print a list of the interfaces on which Wireshark can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the <span><strong class="command">-i</strong></span> flag to specify an interface on which to capture.
	    </p><p>
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking <span><strong class="command">ifconfig -a</strong></span>);
the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the
interface name is a somewhat complex string.
	    </p><p>
Note that "can capture" means that Wireshark was able to open
that device to do a live capture; if, on your system, a program doing a
network capture must be run from an account with special privileges (for
example, as root), then, if Wireshark is run with the <span><strong class="command">-D</strong></span> flag and
is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-f &lt;capture filter&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      This option sets the initial capture filter expression to
	      be used when capturing packets.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-g &lt;packet number&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      After reading in a capture file using the -r flag, go to the given
		  packet number.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-h</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      The <span><strong class="command">-h</strong></span> option requests Wireshark to print
	      its version and usage instructions (as shown above) and exit.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-i &lt;capture interface&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
	    </p><p>
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
<span><strong class="command">wireshark -D</strong></span> (described above); a number, as reported by
<span><strong class="command">wireshark -D</strong></span>, can also be used.  If you're using UNIX, <span><strong class="command">netstat
-i</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">ifconfig -a</strong></span> might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of UNIX support the <span><strong class="command">-a</strong></span> flag to <span><strong class="command">ifconfig</strong></span>.
	    </p><p>
If no interface is specified, Wireshark searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces; if there are no interfaces,
Wireshark reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
	    </p><p>
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or ``-'' to
read data from the standard input.  Data read from pipes must be in
standard libpcap format.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-k</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      The <span><strong class="command">-k</strong></span> option specifies that Wireshark
	      should start capturing packets immediately.  This option
	      requires the use of the <span><strong class="command">-i</strong></span> parameter to
	      specify the interface that packet capture will occur from.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-l</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      This option turns on automatic scrolling if the packet
	      list pane is being updated automatically as packets arrive
	      during a capture ( as specified by the <span><strong class="command">-S</strong></span>
	      flag).
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-L</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
		  List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-m &lt;font&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      This option sets the name of the font used for most text
	      displayed by Wireshark. XXX - add an example!
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-n</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
		Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP
		port names).
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-N &lt;name resolving flags&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      Turns on name resolving for particular types of addresses
	      and port numbers; the argument is a string that may contain
	      the letters <span><strong class="command">m</strong></span> to enable MAC address
	      resolution, <span><strong class="command">n</strong></span> to enable network address
	      resolution, and <span><strong class="command">t</strong></span> to enable transport-layer
	      port number resolution.  This overrides <span><strong class="command">-n</strong></span>
	      if both <span><strong class="command">-N</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">-n</strong></span> are
	      present. The letter C enables concurrent (asynchronous) DNS lookups.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-o &lt;preference/recent settings&gt;</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      Sets a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and
	      any value read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the
	      flag is a string of the form prefname:value, where prefname
	      is the name of the preference (which is the same name that
	      would appear in the preference/recent file), and value is the value
	      to which it should be set.  Multiple instances of
	      <span><strong class="command">-o &lt;preference settings&gt; </strong></span> can be
	      given on a single command line.
	    </p><p>An example of setting a single preference would be: </p><p>
	      <span><strong class="command">
		wireshark -o mgcp.display_dissect_tree:TRUE
	      </strong></span>
	    </p><p>
	      An example of setting multiple preferences would be:
	    </p><p>
	      <span><strong class="command">
		wireshark -o mgcp.display_dissect_tree:TRUE -o mgcp.udp.callagent_port:2627

	    </p><p>
	      The example above would dissect packets with a libpcap data

	      DLT_USER protocol preferences.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span><strong class="command">-p</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
	      Don't put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that
	      the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other
	      reason; hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the only
	      traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the
	      machine on which Wireshark is running, broadcast traffic, and
	      multicast traffic to addresses received by that machine.
