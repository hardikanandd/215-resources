      <p><font face="Courier" size=3><b>Snort</b></font> is a lightweight network
intrusion detection system created by Martin Roesch (see <a
href="http://www.snort.org">http://www.snort.org</a>).  <font face="Courier New"
size=3><b>Snort</b></font> is based on the <font face="Courier"><a
href="/security-improvement/implementations/i042.11.html">libpcap</a></font> packet
capture library, commonly used in may TCP/IP traffic sniffers and analyzers.  According 
to the <font face="Courier New" size=3>Snort</font> web site, the program "can perform
protocol analysis, content searching/matching, and can be used to detect a variety of
attacks and probes, such as buffer overflow, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB
probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more"

<p><font face="Courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> has a real-time alerting
capability, with alerts being sent to <font face="courier" size="3"><b>syslog</b></font>, a separate
"alert" file, or as a WinPopup 
message via Samba's smbclient.

<p>This implementation covers the basic steps to obtain
and install the <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> intrusion detection system on your
computer. We examine how to
write <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> rules and describe how you can validate
generated alerts. This document
does not cover basic or advanced use of the <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> system,
customization of the
installation, configuration of the logging and alerting system, or answer such
questions as where to deploy <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> in your network
environment. For details on these
subjects, ports to other operating systems, plug-ins for reporting, and pre-built rule
sets, consult the <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> web site.</p>

</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Courier" size="3"><P><b>Snort</B></FONT> allows you to write rules
describing</P>


<UL>
<LI>well-known and common vulnerability exploitation attempts</LI>
<LI>violations of your security policy</LI>
<LI>conditions under which you think a network packet(s) might be
anomalous</LI></UL>


<P>Through the use of an easy-to-understand and lightweight rule-description
language, <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> rules can be both flexible 
and robust; written both for protocol analysis and content searching and
matching.</P>

<P>Two basic guiding principles must be kept in mind when writing <B><FONT
FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> rules:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Rules must be completely contained on a single line. </LI>
<LI>Rules are divided into two logical sections, the <I>rule header</I> and the
<I>rule options</I>.  The rule header contains the rule's action, protocol,
source and destination IP addresses and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
block, and the source and destination ports information. The rule option section
contains alert messages. It also contains information about which parts of the
packet you should inspect to determine if you should take the rule action.
</LI></UL>


<P>An example rule: </P>


<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>alert tcp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 111
<br>(content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "mountd access";)</P>
</FONT>
<P>[Example 1 - Sample <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> Rule]</P>


<P>This rule describes an alert that is generated when Snort matches a network
packet with all of the following attributes:</P>


<UL>
<LI>TCP packet</LI>
<LI>Sourced from any IP address on any port</LI>
<LI>Destined for any IP address on the 192.168.1.0 network (24 describes the CIDR 
block and netmask used) on port 111.</LI></UL>


<P>The text up to the first parentheses is the <I>rule header</I>:</P>



<P>"<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>alert tcp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24
111</FONT>"</P>


<P>The section enclosed in parenthesis is the <I>rule options</I>:</P>


<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>"(content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "mountd
access";)"</P>
</FONT>

<P>The word(s) before the colons in the <I>rule options</I> section are called
<I>option keywords</I>. These keywords may appear once, as with ‘content’ in
Example 1 above, or multiple times, as shown in Example 2 below:</P>

<small>
<pre>
alert tcp any any -&gt; any 21 (content:"site exec"; content:"%"; msg:"site
exec buffer overflow attempt";)</pre>
</small>
<P>[Example 2 - Sample <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> Rule]</P>


<P>The above rule illustrates an FTP vulnerability.  The keyword
&quot;content&quot; appears twice because the two strings that
&quot;content&quot; describes are not concatenated but appear at different
locations within the packet(s).  For this rule to be violated, the content of a
packet(s) must contain both character strings, &quot;site exec&quot; and
&quot;%&quot;.</P>

<P>The <I>rule options</I> section is not specifically required by any rule; it is
 used for the sake of making tighter definitions of packets to collect or to
issue an alert. </P>

<P>Elements of an individual rule are treated as forming a logical AND statement. 
 The complete collection of rules in a <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> rules library
file (i.e., snort-lib) are treated as forming
a larger logical OR statement.</P>

<B>Snort</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000"><b> Rules</b></P>
</FONT>

<P><P>Rule Actions: </P>
<P>The <I>rule header</I> contains the information that defines the "who, where,
and what" of a packet, as well as what to do when a packet occurs with all the
attributes indicated in the rule.  The first field in a rule is the rule action.  
The rule action tells <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> what to do
when it finds a packet that matches the rule criteria.  There are three available 
actions in <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> - alert, log, and pass.
</P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>
<P>alert</FONT> - generates an alert using the selected alert method, and then
log the packet </P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>log</FONT> - logs the packet </P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>pass</FONT> - drops (ignore) the packet </P>



<P>Protocols: </P>
<P>The next field in a rule is the protocol.  There are three IP protocols that
<B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> currently analyzes for suspicious
behavior, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.  In the future there may be more, such as ARP,
IGRP, GRE, OSPF, RIP, and IPX.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>IP Addresses: </P>
<P>The next portion of the rule header deals with the IP address and port
information.  The keyword "any" may be used to define any address.  <B><FONT
FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> does not have a mechanism to provide host
name lookup for the IP address fields in the rules file.  The addresses are
formed by a straight numeric IP address and a CIDR block.  The CIDR block
indicates the netmask that should be applied to the rule's address and any
incoming packets that are tested against the rule.  A CIDR block mask of /24
indicates a Class C network, /16 a Class B network, and /32 a specific machine
address.  For example, the address/CIDR combination 192.168.1.0/24 would signify
the block of addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.  Any rule that used
this designation for, say, the destination address would match on any address in
that range.  The CIDR designations give us an easy way to designate large address 
spaces with just a few characters.</P>
<P>In Example 1 (above), the source IP address was set to match for any computer
communicating, and the destination address was set to match on the 192.168.1.0
Class C network. </P>
<P>A negation operator can be applied to IP addresses.  This operator tells
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> to match any IP address except the
one indicated by the listed IP address.  The negation operator is indicated with
a "!".  For example, an easy modification to the initial example is to make it
alert on any traffic that originates outside of the local network with the
negation operator as shown in Example 3.</P>


<FONT FACE="Courier"><small><P>alert tcp !192.168.1.0/24 any -&gt;
192.168.1.0/24 111 <br>(content: "|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "external mountd access";)</P></small>
</FONT><P><br>[Example 3 - Example IP Address Negation Rule]</P>

<P>This rule's IP addresses indicate "any TCP packet with a source IP address not 
originating from the internal network and a destination address on the internal
network".</P>

<P>Port Numbers:</P>
<P>Port numbers may be specified in a number of ways, including "any" ports,
static port definitions, ranges, and by negation.  "Any" ports is a wildcard
value, meaning literally any port.  Static ports are indicated by a single port
number, such as 111 for portmapper, 23 for telnet, or 80 for http.  Port
ranges are indicated with the range operator ":".  The range operator may be
applied in a number of ways, such as in Example 4.       </P>


<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>log udp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 1:1024
</P>
</FONT><P>Log UDP traffic coming from any port and destination ports ranging from 
1 to 1024.</P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>log tcp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 :6000  </P>
</FONT><P>Log TCP traffic from any port going to ports less than or equal to
6000.</P>
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>log tcp any :1024 -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 500:  </P>
</FONT><P>Log TCP traffic from privileged ports less than or equal to 1024 going
to ports greater than or equal to 500.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Example 4 - Port Range Examples]</P>


<P>The negation operator, &quot;!&quot;, may be applied against any of the other
rule types (except "any", which would translate to none).  For example, if for some 
reason you wanted to log everything except the X Windows ports, you could do
something like the rule in Figure 5.</P>

<pre>log tcp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24
!6000:6010</pre>
<br><P>[Example 5 - Example of Port Negation]</P>



<P>Direction Operator: </P>
<P>The direction operator "-&gt;" indicates the orientation, or "direction", of
the traffic that the rule applies to.  The IP address and port numbers on the
left side of the direction operator designate traffic coming from the source
host, and the address and port information on the right side of the operator
designate destination host.  There is also a bi-directional operator, which is
indicated with a "&lt;&gt;" symbol.  This tells <B><FONT FACE="Courier
New">Snort</B></FONT> to consider the address/port pairs in either the source or
destination orientation.  This is handy for recording and analyzing both sides of 
a conversation, such as telnet or POP3 sessions.  An example of the
bi-directional operator being used to record both sides of a telnet session is
shown in Example 6.</P>


<pre>
log !192.168.1.0/24 any &lt;&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 23</pre>
<P>[Example 6 - <font face="courier" size="3"><b>Snort</b></font> rules using the Bi-directional
Operator]</P>

<P>In Example 6, any traffic on any port originating from outside the internal
network (192.168.1.x) with a destination of the internal network on the telnet
port (23) is logged.  Reciprocally, any telnet traffic originating from the
internal network with a destination outside the internal network to any port is
logged.  Therefore, both sides of a telnet connection are logged.</P>

Them</b></P>
</FONT>
<P>Alerting, part of the Alerting and Logging subsystem, is activated at run-time through
the use of command-line options.  In this section, we do not discuss these options, as they
are detailed in documentation on the <A HREF="http://www.snort.org/"><B><FONT FACE="Courier
New">Snort</B></FONT></A> web site.  Instead, we describe how you, the system
administrator, can verify that a <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT>-generated
alert is valid.</P>
<P>To fully trust an intrusion detection system alert, you must be able to examine three
complementary data points: a rule representing behavior you know or suspect of being
anomalous, an alerting message warning you of a rule violation or of particular behavior,
and a network packet (or series of packets) causing the rule violation.  In lieu of having
all three components, you must be able to relate the network packet to at least one of the
following:</P>

<OL>
<LI>the alerting message (of the proposed intrusion or intrusion attempt)</LI>
<LI>the rule violated (of the proposed intrusion or intrusion attempt)</LI></OL>

<P>If neither of these relationships occur, you are precluded from characterizing the
security event as a positive or negative.  The network packet(s) is a critical
point-of-examination, and without the actual, tangible packet(s) we cannot investigate
whether a rule is violated or an alerting message displays a positive occurrence of
violation to our security policy. Therefore, because <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT>
allows you to configure various levels of alerting and logging, we
recommend that <B><FONT FACE="Courier" size="3">Snort</B></FONT> be set up to log the offending
packets causing the rule violation and to record the alerts, in separate files. </P>

<P><P>When <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> inspects a network packet and

<B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> sends an alerting message to the

"may either be sent to syslog, logged to an alert text file in two
different formats, or sent as WinPopup messages using the Samba smbclient program.  The 
syslog alerts are sent as security/authorization messages that are easily monitored
with tools such as <A
HREF="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i042.01.html">swatch</A> 
[SWT93].  WinPopup alerts allow event notifications to be sent to a user-specified list 
of Microsoft Windows consoles running the WinPopup software.  There are two options for 
sending the alerts to a plain text file; full and fast alerting.  Full alerting writes
the alert message and the packet header information through the transport layer
protocol.  The fast alert option writes a condensed subset of the header information to 
the alert file, allowing greater performance under load than  full mode.  There is a
fifth option to completely disable alerting, which is useful when alerting is
unnecessary or inappropriate, such as when network penetrations tests are being
performed."</P>


<P>Similarly, logging can be set up to </P>


<P>"log packets in their decoded, human-readable format to an IP-based
directory structure, or in <A
HREF="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i042.13.html">tcpdump</A> 
binary format to a single log file.  The decoded format logging allows fast analysis of 
data collected by the system.  The tcpdump format is much faster to record to the disk
and should be used in instances where high performance is required. Logging can also be 
turned off completely, leaving alerts enabled for even greater performance
improvements."</P>
</P>

<P>To put this into perspective, let’s examine the logging and alerting areas of a
system.  For this discussion, the system sends alerts to the <B><FONT FACE="Courier
New">syslog</B></FONT> facility and the offending network packet(s) to an IP-based
directory structure.  All alerts are logged via <B><FONT FACE="Courier
New">syslog</B></FONT> to a file called "alerts" in the file /var/adm/snort/alerts.
Any alerting message found in this file will have corresponding offending network
packets logged in the same directory as the alert file but under the IP address of the
source packet.</P>

<P>Using the rule in Figure 1, from above:</P>


<FONT FACE="Courier"><small><P>alert tcp any any -&gt; 192.168.1.0/24 111
<br>(content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "mountd access";)</P></small>
</FONT>

<P>When <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Snort</B></FONT> inspects and matches the above
rule to an offending network packet(s), an alerting message is sent to <B><FONT
FACE="Courier New">syslog</B></FONT> stating that a "mountd access" violation has
occurred.  This message is recorded in the file <I>/var/adm/snort/alerts</I> and the
actual network packet(s) causing the alert is recorded in a file based on the source IP 
address of the offending packet(s), (i.e. <I>/var/adm/snort/a.b.c.d</I>).</P>

<P>Some problems may occur when filtering log entries into an IP-named file.  For one,
multiple alerts may involve one IP address.  Under this condition, the offending
packets violating each unique rule are sent to the same IP-named file; and mapping the
specific alert to the offending packet(s) then demands a search and locate approach
that could be time consuming.</P>
