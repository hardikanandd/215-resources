<td VALIGN=TOP>In the aftermath of a network break-in, system administrators
are often asked to explain what happened. The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) is
a collection of tools that gather and analyze data on a UNIX system and
help the administrator answer this question. <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus</tt>
are part of the toolkit and can be used to restore deleted files and data
that can not be easily accessed.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<tt>unrm</tt> provides access to the unallocated portions of a UNIX file
system and writes the raw data into an output file.</li>

<li>
<tt>lazarus</tt> attempts to reconstruct files or data from raw data. Usually
this raw data is provided by <tt>unrm</tt>. In addition, <tt>lazarus</tt>
can be used to reconstruct data objects from other sources such as system
memory and swap space. The tool has been used with data from UFS, EXT2,
NTFS, and FAT32 file systems, but it can be used on just about any type
of file system. Your success will vary with the way the data is stored.</li>
</ul>
Together both tools provide important assistance whenever files are accidentally
deleted. For the forensic analyst, these tools provide access to files
an intruder may have deleted to hide his attack tools or eliminate important
log information.&nbsp;
<p>As the TCT authors point out, "If there was a theme, it would be the
reconstruction of the past - determining as much as possible what happened
with a static snapshot of a system." Certainly such activities require
an experienced and committed system administrator during the forensic investigation
phase of an intrusion. No software can replace someone who knows his or
her system, but TCT is a start.&nbsp;
<p>In addition to <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus,</tt> TCT contains another
tool, called grave-robber, that can aid in identifying what happened after
a break-in. Grave-robber controls several other tools in an attempt to
capture as much information as possible about a potentially compromised
system and its files. Its use is explained in the implementation
 <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i046.02.html">Using the 
Coroner's Toolkit: Harvesting information with grave-robber.</a>
<p>Using the TCT tools can require a great deal of time and effort. You
need to review all documentation carefully and test all parts before use
so that you can understand and take full advantage of their features. In
particular, when using <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus,</tt> you need to
read the file <tt>help-recovering-file</tt> and <tt>docs/lazarus.README</tt>
which comes as part of the TCT package.&nbsp;
<p>The installation of the TCT toolkit is explained within the implementation
<a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i046.01.html">Installing
The Coroner's Toolkit and using the mactime utility.</a>
<p>This implementation discusses the use of two TCT tools, <tt>unrm</tt>
and <tt>lazarus,</tt> on the Sun Solaris operating system, version 2.x.
You can use this approach with other UNIX operating systems and hosts.</td>

<td>The time needed to retrieve unallocated disk space by <tt>unrm</tt>
depends on the underlying system, its processor, and required disk space.
The time needed to analyze the raw data by <tt>lazarus</tt> depends on
this as well.&nbsp;
<p>Using these tools can take considerable time and create a very large
number of output files. The space needed for the output of <tt>unrm</tt>
is 1000f the unallocated blocks that should be recovered. <tt>lazarus</tt>
will also use approximately 1200f this space.&nbsp;
<p>The technical analysis of this output can easily take days.</td>

<td>The output of <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus</tt> can take considerable
space. For example, for a system with 1.0 GB of unallocated disk space,
<tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus </tt>will need approximately 2.2 GB of free
space to store all output data. You need to create this output data on
another file system; otherwise the unallocated disk space will be used
for the newly created files, thereby destroying the files you are attempting
to recover. In addition, during forensic analysis, you want to minimize
changes to the system under investigation.&nbsp;
<p>Make sure that spare disks are reserved and available when you need
them to store the <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus</tt> output. Make sure
you know how to connect such disks to a live system such that minimal changes
occur on the system being analyzed. Ensure that you mount the disk that
needs to be analyzed as read only on a different system to minimize the
risk of losing interesting data as a result of normal system events. This
implies that <tt>unrm</tt> and <tt>lazarus</tt> are used after <tt><a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i046.02.html">grave-robber</a></tt>.&nbsp;
<p>To reliably analyze any system, you must use unmodified, authentic tools.
Therefore, use write-protected media to store tools like the TCT and others
used during forensic analysis.</td>

data from the unallocated section with <tt>unrm</tt>.</font></font></b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP>To run <tt>unrm,</tt> you first need to identify the appropriate
system device from which to recover the unallocated disk space. Then you
need to identify a safe place to store the retrieved raw data.&nbsp;
<p>For our example, we assume that the system device you want to recover
raw data from is mounted read-only as <tt>/dev/sd6</tt>. To create a safe
place for the analysis results, first create a new directory for all results.
Then assign another account, not the root account, as owner of this directory.
<tt>lazarus</tt> does not depend on root privileges. Check that the output
will be stored on a local disk (<tt>/dev/sd2</tt>) which&nbsp; hosts the
<tt>/spare/tct-data</tt> directory and that enough free space is available:&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># mkdir /spare/tct-data</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># chmod 750 /spare/tct-data</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># chown kpk:wheel /spare/tct-data</font></font>
<p>Based on this information, <tt>unrm</tt> is invoked with the following
command line. We can use the local copy of the TCT tools as we are working
from a secure workstation with the potentially compromised disk mounted
. Additional commands are necessary to arrange the right access controls
as well the ownership and location of the created file:&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># cd /spare/tct-data</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># /usr/local/tct/bin/unrm /dev/sd6
>> unrm-20010303.out</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># chmod 440 unrm-20010303.out</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># chown kpk:wheel unrm-20010303.out</font></font>
<p>If you are interested in the whole disk, use <tt>dd</tt> instead of
<tt>unrm</tt>. Invoke the following command line with the correct values:&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># /bin/dd bs=1024k if=/dev/sd6
> dd-20010303.out</font></font>
<p>The overall size of the output file together with the <tt>lazarus</tt>
output will be 2200f the size of the entire disk.&nbsp;
<p>The <tt>dd</tt> command can also be used to retrieve raw data from other
devices. Use the correct device name as the argument for the <tt>if</tt>
option in the command line above. Be aware that direct interference with
critical files such as kernel memory has the potential to crash your system.&nbsp;
<p>At this stage you have all raw data within a single file and you can
start to use other tools to review this data - such as <tt>od</tt>, <tt>strings</tt>
or <tt>less</tt>.&nbsp;
<p>For the forensic analyst it usually will be helpful to use <tt>lazarus</tt>
to split the huge binary file into several smaller files in addition to
any other method to review the raw data.</td>

<tt>lazarus</tt> to split the raw data into smaller blocks</font></font></b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>lazarus</tt> will operate on any binary file and try
to break it into smaller blocks. While splitting the data into blocks,
<tt>lazarus</tt> will try to identify which kind of data the blocks belong
to. The size of the blocks is 1 KB by default and can be modified by changing
the variable <tt>$BLOCK_SIZE</tt> in the TCT configuration file <tt>/usr/local/tct/conf/lazarus.cf</tt>
(if TCT was installed in <tt>/usr/local/tct/</tt>).&nbsp;
<p>We recommend that you create separate directories to be able to separate
all output data. After changing the user id (to <tt>kpk</tt> as assumed
for our example), change to the directory containing the raw data file
and create two subdirectories for <tt>lazarus-</tt>specific files:&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1># su kpk</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ cd /spare/tct-data</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ mkdir blocks</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ mkdir html</font></font>
<p>You can start <tt>lazarus</tt> using the following options:&nbsp;
<p><tt>-h</tt> creates a HTML-based view that can be used with any browser
to ease access to individual blocks&nbsp;
<br><tt>-D &lt;dir></tt> directs that all blocks be written to the given
directory&nbsp;
<br><tt>-H &lt;dir></tt> directs the main HTML files that provide the overall
navigation to the specified directory&nbsp;
<br><tt>-w &lt;dir></tt> directs that all other HTML output be written
to the given directory&nbsp;
<p>The last argument is the binary file that serves as input for <tt>lazarus</tt>.
After the command terminates, make sure to remove write access to the created
files.&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ /usr/local/tct/bin/lazarus
-h -H . -D /spare/tct-data/blocks -w /spare/tct-data/html unrm-20010303.out</font></font>
<br><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ chmod 440 *.html html/*.html</font></font>
<p><tt>lazarus</tt> takes a considerable amount of time to split the input
file into smaller blocks. After this step, the directory will look similar
to the output below:&nbsp;
<pre><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>$ ls -la /spare/tct-data

the <tt>lazarus</tt> output</font></font></b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>lazarus</tt> handles the input file as follows:&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
A block of the input file is read and the first 100f the data is analyzed
to see if it is text or binary.</li>

<li>
If it consists of printable characters only, it is assumed to be text and
it is then tested against a number of regular expressions to identify C,
HTML or other specific text formats.</li>

<li>
If the block is considered to be binary, a TCT-specific version of the
<tt>file(1)</tt> command is run over this block. If this gives no results,
the first few bytes are analyzed to see if the block is in ELF format.</li>
</ol>
Each block is then written to an output file. If the block has the same
type as the previous block, it is appended. It is also appended if the
block was not recognized as any other known data type. This is based on
the assumption that data from the same file will often be stored continuously
on a disk. Otherwise, a new file is opened and the block is written to
it.&nbsp;
<p>The files written to disk are named according to a specific name scheme.
The first part of the name is based on the actual number of the analyzed
block. The second part (separated by ".") shows the type using a single
letter as defined in the table below. All files are assigned a "txt" extension
(again separated by ".") other than graphic files that are given the extension
"gif" or "jpg".&nbsp;

<p>Links to all files are collected in a kind of map that is presented
as a HTML page. This allows you to access the files by simply selecting
one link and clicking to it. The map uses the same approach to represent
the type of each file as it is used for assigning the file names. The first
block of a sequence of blocks is shown as a capitalized letter. The number
of blocks that are represented within the map is encoded to save space.
The first character represents one block or less, the second from 0 to
2 blocks, the third from 0 to 4 and so on. If five characters are displayed
for one type, this reflects 16 to 31 blocks of data.&nbsp;

<td VALIGN=TOP>The analysis is far from being automated. The level and
success of the analysis depends on the ability of the analyst as well as
the way the data was originally stored on the analyzed system. Therefore,
we can provide no meaningful estimates on how long it will take to go through
the data or how good the results will be.&nbsp;
<p>The <tt>lazarus</tt> documentation suggest various approaches for reviewing
the output:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
If your looking for specific files with known content, search for this
content by characteristic key words etc. The best tool for this is <tt>grep</tt>
or <tt>egrep</tt>. The results will depend on the quality of the key words.</li>

<li>
If you know nothing at all about what might be contained in the raw data,
use some tool such as <tt>less</tt> which can display binary data and can
also be used to go through the data. The HTML navigation map will help
in this task as well.</li>

<li>
If you are only interested in readable output, you might use a tool like
<tt>strings. Use</tt> either the single binary file as input for <tt>strings</tt>
or the split blocks.</li>

<li>
Review specific file types by using the name convention to separate all
files which contain C code. List them using <tt>ls *.c.txt</tt> and then
review the files produced.</li>

<li>
Graphic files could be viewed with a graphical browser.</li>
</ul>
The tools you are using should be capable of handling binary data.&nbsp;
<p>No assistance is provided by <tt>lazarus</tt> to help the analyst re-arrange
single blocks to build larger aggregations. This can be done by concatenating
files manually and editing them to remove raw data not belonging to the
file. This involves making decisions about what blocks belong to each other.
This task is difficult and&nbsp; might affect the overall correctness and
result of the analysis.&nbsp;</td>
