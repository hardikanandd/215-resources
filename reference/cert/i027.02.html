<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>This implementation
contains the recommended procedure for installing and securing (i.e. hardening)
a Sun Sparc server running Solaris Version 2.6. Section 2 contains the
procedure for installing the operating system. Section 3 contains the procedure
for hardening the OS. If the OS is already installed on the system to be
hardened, skip to the hardening section.&nbsp;
<p>We recommend that you install only the minimum essential operating system
configuration, meaning only those packages containing files and directories
that you need to operate your server. Sun provides many diverse packages
to meet the functional needs of most organizations. Using these requires
little or no additional effort beyond installing the operating system.
This approach does not generally serve the needs of the security-conscious
systems administrator. Even with the "Core System Support," which is the
minimum configuration by default, there are many additional security changes
that are desireable.&nbsp;
<p>Our general approach to security is:&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Remove all privilege and access and then only grant (add back in) privilege
and access as needed.</li>

<li>
Enable as much system logging as possible.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
When you perform these tasks, you will gain a much better understanding
of how your system operates, and what constitutes abnormal operation. Using
this knowledge and some additional tools, you can reduce the time required
to administer your system. The more you know about your systems, the more
able you are to detect problems and protect your organization's assets.&nbsp;
<p>We provide time estimates when the amount of time needed to complete
a task can be reasonably estimated or when the time is greater than five
minutes. Our estimate does not include the time required for you to make
decisions based on site-specific issues such as disk partition layout.&nbsp;
<p>We've also written and included two scripts to keep the Solaris software
installation database (/var/sadm/install/contents) consistent with the
changes you make to your system. The first of these is <b><a href="#saferm">saferm</a></b>.
We recommend that you use <b>saferm</b> instead of <b>rm</b> when you need
to remove files and directories. <b>Saferm</b> uses <b>removef</b> to keep
the installation database current.&nbsp;
<p>The second tool is <b><a href="#safeinstallf">safeinstallf</a></b>.
It is a simple front-end for the installf program. We recommend that you
use <b>safeinstallf</b> after making any file and directory changes, such
as when you use <b>chmod</b>,
<b>chown</b>, or change a configuration file.&nbsp;

Step: A Survival Guide for Solaris Security, Version 1.0, The SANS Institute,

2.6 installation</font></font></b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>We strongly recommend
that when you install Solaris 2.6 on a machine, you disconnect that machine
from the network. Generally, the distribution CD contains packages that
have vulnerabilities which are fixed by subsequent patches. If the machine
being built is connected to the network during installation, it is possible
for an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities before you've had time
to patch them.&nbsp;
<p>Furthermore, we recommend that if you download any files from the internet,
such as OS patches, you should use another machine which you know to be
secure. The changes that you download should then be transported via tape
(or some other secure manner) to the target machine.&nbsp;
<p>Note: You need the following information before you begin the installation
process:&nbsp;
<blockquote>IP Name&nbsp;
<br>IP Address&nbsp;
<br>Subnet Mask&nbsp;
<br>Default Gateway&nbsp;
<br>DNS Server&nbsp;
<br>Domain Name&nbsp;
<br>Time Zone&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>Boot Time Configuration</b>
<br>Perform SANS Guide steps 1.1.1 to 1.1.8, Basic OS Installation.&nbsp;
<br>With the exception of step 1.1.5, select "other".&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<p><b>Minimal OS Installation</b>
<br>Perform SANS Guide steps 1.2.1 to 1.2.7, Minimal OS Installation.&nbsp;
<br>With the exception of 1.2.4, also select "System Accounting"&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 30 minutes&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>File System Layouts&nbsp;</b>
<br>There is considerable debate about file system layout. Some choose
to have one large file system mounted as /; others prefer the more traditional
layout as suggested in the SANS Guide. There are arguments that support
both; choose the layout that is best for your application.&nbsp;
<p><b>Installed Packages</b>
<br>Install only those packages needed target machine. Each additional
package potentially introduces another vulnerability to the system.&nbsp;
<p><b>System Accounting</b>
<br>System accounting provides a log of all processes that run on the system.
Unfortunately it does not log all available information (such as the pathname
to the program executed) and is not as useful as it could be. However,
it can be used to correlate events with other system logs. System accounting
also gives you a better understanding of what processes run, when they
run, and how long they run. You can use this information to determine if
something abnormal is occurring on your system.&nbsp;</blockquote>

hardening</font></font></b></h3>
</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<ol>We recommend that you install the system from scratch. We recognize
that you may need to harden an existing system (and the following steps
may be followed in either case); however hardening an existing system is
a more difficult task.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you are hardening a machine on which you have already installed Solaris,
first remove all packages not needed for the operation of your server.
The presence of any package not required for the services provided by the
system reduces the security of the system.</li>

<p><br>Estimated time required: > 1 hour, depending on how many packages
are installed.&nbsp;
<p>Note: Files and directories to be removed should be removed with <b><a href="#saferm">saferm</a></b>.
You should run <b><a href="#safeinstallf">safeinstallf</a></b> after changing
any attribute of a file. Links to both scripts are found at the top of
this implementation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Verify that the file <i>/etc/hostname.&lt;interface><interface> </i>contains
only the hostname of the machine in the appendix to this implementation.</li>

<p><br>This is to verify the information that was given during the installation.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Verify that the file <i>/etc/inet/hosts</i> contains:</li>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+0>
127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
localhost</font><ip address>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;IP address>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;hostname>&nbsp;</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;IP address>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size=+0>loghost</font>
<br><font size=+0>If you have a central logging host, add an entry for
it as well. See Configuring and using syslogd to collect logging messages
on systems running Solaris 2.x". In this case, the file <i>/var/inet/hosts</i>
should contain:</font>
<p><font size=+0>127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
localhost</font>
<br><font size=+0>&lt;IP address>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;hostname> loghost</font>
<p>The <i>/etc/inet/hosts</i> file may contain other hosts on your network.
For instance, the file <i>/etc/nsswitch.conf</i> contains:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+0>&nbsp;
hosts:&nbsp;&nbsp; files dns.&nbsp;</font>
<p>This configuration prevents some DNS attacks on your system. The disadvantage
of this approach is that for every host configured this way, you must make
changes to keep the information consistent.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Verify that the file <i>/etc/inet/netmasks</i> conains:</li>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Network Number>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;Subnet Mask>&nbsp;
<p>This step is performed to verify the accuracy of information that was
given during the installation.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 1.3.1 to 1.3.5, Post Install/Networking Configuration.</li>

<p><br>Set a very secure password for the root account. <b>Npasswd</b>
is a tool that can be installed and used to help set secure passwords.
See <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i028.05.html">"Installing,
configuring, and using npasswd to improve password quality on systems running
Solaris 2.x"</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 5 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 1.4.2 to 1.4.7, Installing Patches.</li>

<br>Note: We have not had a problem with the unmodified patchadd script
for Solaris 2.6 Hardware 3/98&nbsp;
<p>Installing the latest patches from Sun protects the system from many
vulnerabilities that have been discovered since the distribution CD was
produced. If you fail to do this, the system that you have just installed
is unnecessarily vulnerable to attack. There are many automated tools on
the Internet that probe systems looking for known vulnerabilites.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: > 1 hour, depending on the number of patches
to install.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Install Tripwire (See <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i002.02.html">"Installing,
configuring, and using Tripwire to verify the integrity of directories
and files on systems running Solaris 2.x"</a>).</li>

<p><br>You can use Tripwire (for accounting purposes) to keep track of
changes you make during this installation. With it, you can monitor the
changes you make to files on the system during normal operation. This can
give you more insight about how your system works. You can use this information
to determine if something unexpected happened, meriting further investigation.
Build Tripwire on a development machine that has a C compiler and transfer
it securely to the target machine. We recommend that service machines not
have compilers installed.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Install SSH (See "Installing, configuring, and operating the secure shell
(SSH) on systems running Solaris 2.x").</li>

<p><br>SSH provides a more secure way of connecting and copying files to
a machine. SSH should be built on a development machine that has a C compiler
and transferred securely to the target machine. Service machines should
not have compilers installed.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide step 2.1.1, <i>Purging Boot Directories of Unecessary
Services</i>.</li>

<p><br>Other run levels should not be used; remove them using <b><a href="#saferm">saferm</a>.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.1.2 to 2.1.5 and 2.1.7, but remove the files
with <b><a href="#saferm">saferm</a></b> instead of renaming them. For
example:</li>

<p><br>saferm S80PRESERVE&nbsp;
<p>instead of:&nbsp;
<p>mv S90PRESERVE . NOS80PRESERVE&nbsp;
<p>Verify that these settings will not interfere with the normal operation
of the machine. NFS and RPC services should be avoided because they have
many vulnerabilities. Enabling these services opens the target system to
attacks on well-known vulnerabilities of these services. Step 2.1.6 can
be done if <b>sendmail</b> is invoked from <b>cron</b>; see also step 2.5.3.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide step 2.1.8 and 2.1.9.</li>

<br>We recommend that the <b>umask</b> in step 2.1.8 be set to 027 and
the system run for a time to determine if this change is practical in your
environment. This change makes any file created by normal system operation
not world-readable by default. If problems result, you should consider
creating a group that contains a list of users who may need to read files
created by system daemons.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide step 2.1.10.</li>

<p><br>If you need DHCP or multicast support, do not replace the <i>/etc/init.d/inetsvc</i>
file. Servers should not use DHCP. Attacks on DHCP servers may allow the
host information for the service machines to be compromised.&nbsp;
<p>If inetd services are needed, uncomment the inetd line at the end of
the <i>/etc/init.d/inetsvc</i> file.&nbsp;
<p>Remove all <b>inetd</b> services.
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; sed -e 's/^\([^#]\)/#\1/' &lt; /etc/inetd.conf
> /etc/inetd.new&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mv /etc/inetd.new /etc/inetd.conf&nbsp;</font>
<p>Enable only the services that are required.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: If no <b>inetd</b> services are needed, &lt;
5 minutes. If <b>inetd</b> services are needed, 10 minutes.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.5, Cleaning House.</li>

<p><br>If you need printing support, do not remove the<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
lp</font> user and related crontab entries. The printing subsystem may
have vulnerabilities and should not be used on service machines.&nbsp;
<p>If performance statistics are being collected using <b>sar</b>, do not
remove the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">sys</font> crontab
entry.
<p>If <b>inetd</b> services are needed, skip 2.2.3.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Install TCP wrappers. See <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i041.07.html">"Installing,
configuring, and using tcp wrapper to log unauthorized connection attempts
on systems running Solaris 2.x"</a>.</li>

<p><br>If you are not installing any services in <i>/etc/inetd.conf </i>to
be started by <b>inetd</b>, the TCP wrappers do not need to be installed.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If possible, perform SANS Guide steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.3, <i>File System Configuration</i>.</li>

<p><br>Mounting the file systems as read only and nosuid preclude changes
to files and programs that could result from unauthorized access or attempts
to corrupt data. All file systems should be configured in this manner,
if possible.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Set enhanced syslog logging:</li>

<br>The end of the file<i> /etc/syslog.conf </i>should contain:&nbsp;
<p>kern.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/kern.log&nbsp;
<br>user.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/user.log&nbsp;
<br>mail.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/mail.log&nbsp;
<br>daemon.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /var/log/all/daemon.log&nbsp;
<br>auth.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/auth.log&nbsp;
<br>syslog.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/syslog.log&nbsp;
<br>lpr.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/lpr.log&nbsp;
<br>news.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/news.log&nbsp;
<br>uucp.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/uucp.log&nbsp;
<br>cron.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/cron.log&nbsp;
<br>local0.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local0.log&nbsp;
<br>local1.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local1.log&nbsp;
<br>local2.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local2.log&nbsp;
<br>local3.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local3.log&nbsp;
<br>local4.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local4.log&nbsp;
<br>local5.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local5.log&nbsp;
<br>local6.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local6.log&nbsp;
<br>local7.debug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/var/log/all/local7.log&nbsp;
<p>Note: The whitespace between the type and action <b>must </b>be created
by using tabs only (for example, between lpr.debug and /var/log/all/lpr.log).
The files listed as recipients of logging information (for example var/log/all/lpr.log)
must exist before <b>syslogd</b> will write log information to them.&nbsp;
<p>Configuring <b>syslogd</b> in this way allows the system administrator
to examine the activities of each daemon that writes to that log level.
The logs give you insight about how the system is working, and you can
use them to determine if something unexpected is happening on the machine.
This configuration generates a lot of information in the log files. <b>Newsyslog</b>
should be modified to rotate the log files on a regular basis. (Refer to
<a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i041.09.html">"Using
newsyslog to rotate files containing logging messages on systems running
Solaris 2.x"</a>) All logging information should be archived for later
analysis.&nbsp;
<p>See also <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i041.08.html">"Configuring
and using syslogd to collect logging messages on systems running Solaris
2.x "</a>,<a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i042.01.html">"Installing,

<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.4.3 and 2.4.4, Additional Logging.</li>

<br>This log shows if someone is repeatedly trying to log into the system.
Regularly examine this file, as well as the other log files. You can add
these files to the /usr/lib/newsyslog to rotate this logfile.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.5.1 to 2.5.3, Sendmail.</li>

<p><br>If you do not want to replace the vendor-supplied version of sendmail,
follow steps 2.5.2 and 2.5.3. Another option is to remove the -bd option
to the daemon from the file <i>/etc/init.d/sendmail.</i> This denies incoming
mail and protects the system from some possible vulnerabilities in the
sendmail package. Some vulnerabilities may exist in the vendor-supplied
sendmail package. These could be exploited.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes, if the Open Source package is already
compiled.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.6.1 to 2.6.5, Fix-modes script.</li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fix-modes</font> is a
script that tries to make the filesystem modes more secure. It does this
by removing the group and world write permissions of all files, devices,
and directories listed in <i>/var/sadm/install/contents</i> (with the exception
of those listed in <i>exceptions.h</i> that come with the source distribution).
Additionally <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">fix-modes</font>
changes the ownership of most files to root and removes all write permission
from non-root owned executables. Use the PGP utilities to verify the contents
of the package after downloading from the Internet.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform the following steps in addition to (or in lieu of) the steps in
the SANS Guide.</li>

<p><br>Examine all file ownership and protections. There should be no world-writeable
files on the system. Check for world-writeable files with the following:&nbsp;
<p><font size=+0>find&nbsp; /&nbsp; -local&nbsp; !&nbsp; -type&nbsp; l&nbsp;
-perm -0002 -ls >&nbsp; /var/log/world-writeable-files&nbsp;</font>
<p>Examine setUID, setGID, and group-writeable to determine what files
need to have these set.&nbsp;
<p><font size=+0>find&nbsp; /&nbsp; -local&nbsp; !&nbsp; -type&nbsp; l&nbsp;
-perm&nbsp; -4000&nbsp; -ls >&nbsp; /var/log/suid-files&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=+0>find&nbsp; /&nbsp; -local&nbsp; !&nbsp; -type&nbsp; l&nbsp;
-perm&nbsp; -2000&nbsp; -ls >&nbsp; /var/log/sgid-files&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=+0>find&nbsp; /&nbsp; -local&nbsp; !&nbsp; -type&nbsp; l&nbsp;
-perm&nbsp; -0020&nbsp; -ls >&nbsp; /var/log/group-writeable-files&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=+0>find&nbsp; /&nbsp; -local&nbsp; !&nbsp; -type&nbsp; l&nbsp;
-perm&nbsp; -0001&nbsp; -ls >&nbsp; /var/log/world-executable-files&nbsp;</font>
<p>Examine these results and restict file permissions as much as possible.
Only programs that need to be setUID/setGID should be and all others should
not be. Only programs that need to be group/world-executable should be,
and all others should not be, etc. Document each change (or decision not
to change) each file's permission and record your rationale. Tripwire can
be used to track the changes made to the files. This task is time-intensive
but necessary. Any changes that you make should be recorded in /var/sadm/install/contents
with <b><a href="#safeinstallf">safeinstallf</a></b>.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perform SANS Guide steps 2.7.1 to 2.7.9, Miscellaneous.</li>

<p><br>The EEPROM change is for physical security. No one can boot the
machine with alternate media to get information from the machine.&nbsp;
<p>The <i>ftpusers</i> file restricts the users listed in the file from
using <b>ftp</b> to connect to the system. The <b>scp</b> command from
the SSH package should be used as a secure way in which to transfer files
instead.&nbsp;
<p>If <b>rlogin</b> or <b>rsh</b> are needed, removing the entry from the
<i>pam.conf</i>
file causes rlogin and rsh to ignore the <i>.rhosts</i> and <i>hosts.equiv</i>
files. <b>Rlogin</b> and <b>rsh</b> will then always require a password.
Where possible, use SSH instead.&nbsp;
<p>Estimated time required: 10 minutes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If possible, disable all remote commands with the following:</li>

<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rcp
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rdate
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rdist
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/remsh
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rlogin
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rpcinfo
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rsh
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rksh
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rup
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/ruptime
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rusers
<br>saferm&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/bin/rwho&nbsp;
<p>Removing all remote commands will protect the system from vulnerabilities
in these programs.&nbsp;
