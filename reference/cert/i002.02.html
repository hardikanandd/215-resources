      <p>Tripwire<small><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></small> is a file system integrity-checking 
program for UNIX operating systems. To use it, 
you first must build a configuration file that designates the directories and files that you want to verify and the attributes you want to have verified for each. You then run Tripwire (with the initialize option) to create a database of cryptographic checksums that correspond to the files and directories specified in the configuration file. 

<p>To protect the Tripwire program, configuration file, and initialized database against corruption, be sure to transfer them to a medium that can be designated as physically write-protected, such as a disk or CD-ROM. This read-only version then becomes the authoritative reference program, configuration, and data, which you can reliably use to test the integrity of directories and files on your system.

<p>In addition to one or more cryptographic checksums representing the contents of each directory and file, the Tripwire database also contains information that allows you to verify:
<ul>
<li>access permissions and file mode settings, including effective execution settings 
<li>inode number in the file system 
<li>number of links 
<li>user ID of the owner 
<li>group ID of the group of users to which access may be granted 
<li>size of the item 
<li>date and time the item was last accessed, the last modification made to the item, and the creation date and time associated with the item's inode
</ul>
<p>For any system, you want to verify the integrity of all critical operating system directories and files, plus any other directories and files that you consider sensitive or that have no reason to change under normal conditions. Pay particular attention to executable programs, daemons, scripts, and the libraries and configuration files associated with them.

<p>The default Tripwire configuration file for Solaris provides a good starting point, but you need to carefully review and edit it to reflect your system. Consult the <font face="courier new"><small>filesystem(5)</small></font> manual page for details about how the Solaris 2.x file system is organized, and for descriptions of directories that include files that you should verify.

<p>When choosing which attributes of files and directories to verify, you need to consider how they are used on your system. For example, you know that your log files grow as events cause records to be written to them, so verifying the constancy of the file size for these files does not make sense. However, monitoring changes to the size of system binaries or to access permissions for log files is probably warranted.

<p>The time needed to retrieve the source code from the distribution site varies depending upon your connection speed. The source code is less than 283 KB (version 1.3.1-1). Building and installing Tripwire depends upon machine performance but on average will take less than ten minutes. 

<p>You will need to allocate several days of staff effort to determine a comprehensive configuration suitable for your environment that is tailored to minimize the generation of any misleading or unnecessary messages. Extraneous messages that do not require your attention will show up during this initial period of use. You will need to make adjustments and tailor to meet your reporting requirements as you go. 

<p>Tripwire database updates are required if new software or new releases are added to your system configuration. These actions may also require further tailoring of your Tripwire configuration.

<li>Insert the disk with the protect tab set to writable.

<font face="courier new"><small># fdformat -v /dev/rdisk</small></font>

<li>Create a file system on the floppy disk:<br>
<font face="courier new"><small># newfs -v /dev/rdisk</small></font>

<li>Create the /floppy mount directory:<br>
<font face="courier new"><small># mkdir /floppy</small></font>

<li>Mount the floppy disk as read-write:<br>
<font face="courier new"><small># mount -n /dev/disk /floppy</small></font>

<li>Create the /floppy/databases data directory:<br>
<font face="courier new"><small># mkdir /floppy/databases</small></font>
</ol>
<p>If you prefer to use a CD-ROM, refer to other technical sources for its proper configuration and use. Once you have a working CD-ROM writer, it should act as any other media device with respect to its interaction with Tripwire.

<p>Once you have built and tested Tripwire, you need to address several additional topics that are important for the program's overall use. Not all files need the same level of protection. Tripwire comes with multiple cryptographic signature algorithms. Some execute more quickly than others and some are more secure than others. (See the Tripwire User Manual for a discussion of the individual algorithms.) You will need to tailor your configuration files to reflect this tradeoff between security and performance. Tripwire's default setting is to use two algorithms to calculate cryptographic checksums; MD5 and Snefru. Using MD5 alone should be sufficient for most files and directories.

<p>Tripwire can be run in one of four modes:

    <td align="LEFT" valign="TOP">
<p>Integrity checking requires that a previously generated database exists against which to compare. Such a database is created by the <font face="courier new"><small>tw.config</small></font> file once you start database generation. Once you have configured the <font face="courier new"><small>tw.config</small></font> file as desired and have successfully installed Tripwire, insert the prepared floppy disk (disable write protection if necessary) and type the following commands:
<pre>
# mount -n /dev/disk /floppy
# tripwire -initialize
</pre>      
<p>The first command mounts the floppy. The second command creates a file named <font face="courier new"><small>tw.db_&lt;the local system's host name&gt;</small></font> within the directory <font face="courier new"><small>/floppy/databases/</small></font>. This file is the authoritative copy to which the Tripwire program refers when checking the file system's integrity for this host. You can use the automatic or interactive update modes to maintain this database whenever changes are made to the system that need to be reflected in the Tripwire database.

<p>After completing database generation, place a copy of the Tripwire program and its configuration file on the same disk as the database to protect the Tripwire software and critical files. Restrict access via the ownership and permissions settings on the files written to the disk so that only the root user can read them. Having all files on a write-protected floppy disk allows you to easily identify any changes by comparing versions on the disk to an authoritative reference copy. Once this step is complete, unmount and eject the floppy disk. The commands to execute this step are as follows:
<pre>
# cp /etc/tw.config /floppy
# cp /usr/local/bin/tripwire /floppy
# umount /floppy
</pre>      
<p>Shift the write-protect tab on the disk to disable writing to it. This write-protected disk now represents your authoritative reference. Store this floppy in a physically secure location. Create an exact copy of the disk to work with so that you do not need to use the original.

<p>In phase 4, Tripwire summarizes its findings. 454 files have changed in some way but according to the rules that are specified in the configuration file, none of these changes is considered unexpected. The detected changes are probably associated with the most recent read accesses to the files, which we have chosen to ignore. If any files are modified unexpectedly, this modification is reported, as illustrated in example 2.

<p>The first two lines of phase 4 of the report are listing new files that are created when the <font face="courier new"><small>admintool</small></font> is executed to add the new user. The next three lines represent previously existing directories and files that have changed as a result of the addition. Phase 5 shows the following modifications:
<ul>
<li><font face="courier new"><small>inode</small></font> creation timestamps on the <font face="courier new"><small>/etc</small></font> directory
<li>several attributes of the <font face="courier new"><small>/etc/passwd</small></font> file
<li>the inode number of the <font face="courier new"><small>/etc/shadow</small></font> file
</ul>
<p>It is evident that the contents of the <font face="courier new"><small>/etc/passwd</small></font> file changed, since its size and cryptographic checksums (MD5, Snefru) changed.

<p>In both of the previous examples, phase 2 reports that four files are missing. 
This reporting occurs because the files were specified in the configuration file at the time the Tripwire configuration was initialized, but they did not exist at the time the database was generated.

<p>If files are deleted, the line specifying the number of files deleted is non-zero in phase 4:

<p><font face="courier new"><small>### Files deleted: 4</small></font>

<p>Similarly, a more detailed entry indicates which file has been deleted: 

<p><font face="courier new"><small>deleted: -rw-r----- 0 36 Jul 3 10:48:26 1997 /etc/testdir/testfile</small></font>

<p>Depending on how you have configured the parent directory scan, more information can be reported to indicate any changes related to the directory where the missing file was previously located.

As stated above in the "Downloading and Verifying" section of this implementation, the open source version is called Tripwire 1.3 ASR
(Academic Source Release). It is the latest version available as
source code for Solaris and other UNIX operating system variants. For this implementation, we assume that you are using this version.
<p>
Tripwire was originally developed in 1992 at Purdue University. Since that time, it has been downloaded and used by thousands of
individuals and organizations. In 1998, Purdue transferred management of Tripwire to
<a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com">Tripwire Security Solutions, Inc. (TSS)</a> . TSS currently offers multiple distributions of
Tripwire for purchase and at no charge. Newer versions (than the version used in this implementation) are available for purchase.
Because of operating system coverage (which now includes Windows/NT) and significant improvements in functionality, we recommend that
you evaluate TSS versions for use in your environment. The latest version available for sale is version 2.2.1. 
<p>
In addition, a free version of 2.2.1 is also available from Tripwire Security for Linux. According to their web page,
 <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/downloads/index.cfml">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/downloads/index.cfml</a>, the following
is true: "Linux is officially supported on RedHat 5.2 and 6.0. Other distributed versions of Linux are not officially supported, but
basic functionality has been verified on RedHat 6.1, and various distributions of Debian, Caldera, Open Linux, and SuSE systems using
Linux kernel 2.0.36 or higher." If you operate Linux, we recommend that you retrieve and install this version of Tripwire.
 Note that the differences between 1.3.1 and 2.2.1 are so significant that the
majority of this implementation does not accurately document version 2.2.1. Use Tripwire Security's documentation to guide you through
that version's installation and operation.
<p>
A comparison between the for-purchase and no charge versions can be found at <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/products/index.cfml">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/products/index.cfml</a>. The
links for downloading either version for use with a UNIX operating system are contained at the bottom of their web page.
<p>
Other open source versions of Tripwire are available via the Internet. Generally, these non-TSS open source versions are not as well
maintained. As a result, we recommend using the version available through TSS if you chose not to use the version used in this
implementation.
