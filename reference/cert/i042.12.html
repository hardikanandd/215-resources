<p>The tool <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is used to display the process accounting records on UNIX systems where process accounting has been enabled. It provides information from the accounting records created by <i><b>accton</b></i> by using command line expressions to query accounting logs and translating them into a human-readable form. <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is similar to <a href="/security-improvement/implementations/i042.04.html"><font face="courier"><b>spar</b></font></a> (Show Process Accounting Records) but requires more processor time to return queries and offers fewer query options.

<p><font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is useful to you as an administrator when you need access to accounting record logs and are precluded from adding untested or publicly available software tools (such as <font face="courier"><b>spar</b></font>) to your computing environment.

<p>It provides data that you can use to determine if unauthorized processes have been executed. For example, you can use the tool to baseline the normal execution of system processes for a specific time period and compare this information with process accounting data collected at a later, equivalent time period. In this manner, you begin to characterize the normal behavior of a particular system and ultimately recognize those behaviors that fall outside of normal or expected bounds.

<tr valign="top">
<td width="130"></td>
<td align="left">
<font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is run with or without options from the command line and in the following format:
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
# lastcomm [<i>command-name</i>] ... [<i>user-name</i>] ... [<i>terminal-name</i>] ...
</pre></font>
<p>For each process accounting entry <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> displays the following information (taken from the <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> man page):
<ul>
<li>command name under which process was called<p>
<li>one or more flags to indicate special information about process<p>
<ul>
<li>F - when the process has performed a fork but not an exec<p>
<li>S - when the process ran as a set-user-id program<p>
</ul>
<li>name of the user who ran process<p>
<li>terminal user was logged into when process executed<p>
<ul>
<li>"_ _" - when no controlling tty for process<p>
<li>"??" - when controlling tty could not be decoded into a printable name<p>
</ul>
<li>amount of CPU time used by process (in seconds)<p>
<li>date and time process exited
</ul>
<p>Under basic execution with no options, <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> returns ASCII output to the terminal, similar to:

<p>
When <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is run with command line options, it returns information specified by any or all of three attribute options: command name, user name, or terminal name. See the <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> man page for more detail on these options. The following examples illustrate these options:

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Basic Example 1:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
	# lastcomm sendmail
</pre></font>
<p>
Returns only those accounting records where the executed process was <font face="courier"><b>sendmail</b></font>.

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Basic Example 2:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
	# lastcomm root 
</pre></font>
<p>
Returns only those accounting records where a process was executed by the user "root".

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Basic Example 3:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
	# lastcomm fb
</pre></font>
<p>
Returns only those accounting records where a process was executed from the terminal "fb".

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Combined Example 1:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
	# lastcomm accton root

The above examples show <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> as a function of normal administration where the administrator wants to determine whether a specific process has been executed, by whom, and from where. You can also extend <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> to be a function of security and to determine whether processes have been executed by proper users and from proper locations. In this way, you can use <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> to track down privileged commands executed under other-than-normal circumstances.

<td align="left">
Though <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> is more useful when combined with multiple command line options as shown in the combined examples under "Basic Use" above, the tool is limited to combinations of the three attributes: command name, user name, and terminal name. This limitation prevents the execution of more complex queries on the process accounting logs. For example, <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> cannot be executed to report only those processes that root or another privileged user has run between certain dates and times. To accomplish more advanced queries, <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> must be combined with other command line tools. Additionally, its output can be compared against the output of other tools to create a more complete picture of a system and help recognize unexpected events.

When integrated with other native text tools, <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> can be used to return more useful information in a manner that allows you to begin to characterize the normal behavior of your system. The following are some examples of <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> combined with other text tools:

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Example 1:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
# lastcomm root | grep mon

<p>
Returns only those processes run by the user 'root' on a specific day of the week&#151;in this case Mondays&#151;by returning process accounting lines satisfying the <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> and grep arguments.

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Example 2:</font></h4>
<pre><font face="courier" size="2">
# lastcomm root | grep tue | sort
</pre></font>
<p>

<h4>Automated Use</h4>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="130"></td>
<td align="left">
Two aspects of automation can be used to better understand process accounting information: characterizing normal behavior and reporting items of interest generated by <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> through automation. It is important that you review accounting records over a sufficient period of time to become familiar with the normal operation of your system. This will enable you to recognize abnormal events and to determine what circumstances a process is run by either a user or another program. While this time period may fluctuate based on the role and function of a particular system, it is good practice to spend at least one month collecting process data before comparing normal (versus abnormal) events.

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Characterizing normal behavior.</font></h4>
Process accounting records log information to the file <i>/var/adm/pacct</i> or elsewhere if another file is specified. <font face="courier"><b>newsyslog</b></font> can then be used to rotate the accounting logs on a periodic basis to keep the logs down to a manageable size for use with <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font>. Additionally, if <a href="/security-improvement/implementations/i041.09.html"><font face="courier"><b>newsyslog</b></font></a> is set up to rotate log files on a weekly basis, you can begin to characterize normal function. You do this by comparing information generated by <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> under a specific log period against another log period covering the same timeframe. For example, you might run <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> on a previous week's worth of accounting data to determine the number of instances a process executed and compare this with the current week's worth of processing data for the same process.

<p>For help in configuring <font face="courier"><b>newsyslog</b></font> in rotating logs, see <a href="/security-improvement/implementations/i041.09.html">Using newsyslog to rotate files containing logging messages on systems running Solaris 2.x</a>. 

<h4><font face="helvetica, geneva, arial">Reporting items of interest generated by <font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font>.</font></h4>
<font face="courier"><b>lastcomm</b></font> can be automated by adding the tool to a daily or weekly <b><i>cron</i></b> job where the tool is set to execute with a specific set of options, such as mentioned in the examples above. For example, you might want to find out how many times a command (such as <font face="courier">useradd</font>, <font face="courier">passwd</font>, <font face="courier">chgrp</font>, <font face="courier">chown</font>) was executed, by whom, from where, for how long, and at what times. By doing this you can determine whether
<ul>
<li>a privileged command was run during non-normal business hours or by non-privileged users
<p><li>an unusual process executed when it was not supposed to 
<p><li>other items of interest specific to your normal processes
