<td VALIGN=TOP>This implementation describes how to disable a network service
on the Sun Solaris operating system, version 2.x. The method should also
work with many other UNIX operating systems and hosts. Note that application
systems, while executing, may also provide access to network services.
We do not address application-specific network service access.
<p>Disabling a network service may not always completely restrict an intruder's
access to your network because they may have other ways to access it. However,
disabling a network service will terminate at least one direct access path
that likely was established when the intruder took advantage of a security
vulnerability within the network service software. If an intruder used
the network service as the primary means for gaining access, and installed
no alternative means for access (such as sniffed passwords, backdoors,
etc.), then disabling the network service can deny further access to the
intruder until you can install a corrected version of the network service.&nbsp;</td>

<p>Prior to executing these steps and if appropriate, make a full backup

This line causes <tt>inetd</tt> to accept an incoming TCP connection for
the <tt>finger</tt> service and pass this connection on to the <tt>in.fingerd</tt>
program. Commenting this line out is sufficient to disable the network
service. However, you should also include comments that describe the reason
for disabling the service, your name, and the date. This will keep another
administrator from inadvertently re-enabling the service, thinking that
it may have been mistakenly disabled. An example update is as follows:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>#

After the next boot process, the now-disabled network service will not

<td VALIGN=TOP>Standalone services are started when the system boots. They
can execute continuously and accept connections. Other network services
started via <tt>inetd</tt> incur additional overhead and delay when compared
to standalone services.&nbsp;
<p>We do not recommend that you delete the links in the various <tt>/etc/rc*.d/</tt>
directories as you may need to enable these at a later time. We do recommend
that you change the startup script explicitly.&nbsp;
<p>Usually a startup script has the following structure:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>#!/bin/sh





case "$1" in


'start')


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;


'stop')

*)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/xxx { start | stop }"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;





esac


exit 0</font></pre>
To disable the start of a network service, add lines to the beginning of
the script that&nbsp; read as follows:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>#!/bin/sh





#

echo "Warning: /etc/init.d/xxx disabled for security reasons"


exit 0





case "$1" in

During the next boot process,&nbsp; a warning message will be displayed
and the disabled service will not be started. You can re-enable the service
by removing the inserted lines.</td>

To avoid any execution of the program <tt>in.fingerd</tt> (which implements
the <tt>finger</tt> service), you need to make sure that the <tt>tcp wrapper</tt>
