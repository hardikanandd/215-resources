<td VALIGN=TOP>In the aftermath of a network break-in, system administrators
are often asked to explain what happened. The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) is
a collection of tools that gather and analyze data on a UNIX system and
help the administrator answer that question. <tt>grave-robber</tt> is the
central application of the toolkit used to achieve this goal. This program controls
several other tools in an attempt to capture as much information as possible
about a potentially compromised system and its files.&nbsp;
<p>As the TCT authors point out: "If there was a theme, it would be the
reconstruction of the past - determining as much as possible what happened
with a static snapshot of a system." Certainly such activities require
an experienced and committed system administrator during the forensic investigation
phase of an intrusion. No software can replace someone who knows his or
her system, but TCT is a start.&nbsp;
<p>In addition to <tt>grave-robber,</tt> TCT contains two tools, <tt>unrm</tt>
and <tt>lazarus</tt>,which can work together to help&nbsp; identify what
happened after a break-in. These tools can also be used to recover&nbsp;
files deleted by accident. While <tt>unrm</tt> makes a copy of all accessible,
unallocated (free) disk space, <tt>lazarus</tt> analyzes this copy and
tries to determine each block of data and its type (text versus graphics,
etc.). Their use is explained in another <a href="../Attachments/tct-unrm.htm">implementation.</a>
<p>Using the TCT tools can require a great deal of time and effort. You
need to review all documentation carefully and test all parts before use
so that you can understand and take full advantage of their features. In
particular, when using <tt>grave-robber,</tt> you need to read the file
<tt>help-when-broken-into</tt> which comes as part of the TCT documentation.&nbsp;
<p>The installation of the TCT toolkit is explained in the implementation
<a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i046.01.html">Installing
The Coroner's Toolkit and using the mactime utility</a><a href="../Attachments/tct-mactime.htm">.</a>
<p>This implementation discusses the use of one TCT tool <tt>grave-robber</tt>
on the Sun Solaris operating system, version 2.x. You can use this approach
with other UNIX operating systems and hosts.</td>

<td>The time needed to retrieve all data collectable by the TCT tools depends
on the underlying system, its processor, and required disk space. Using
these tools can take considerable time and can create a large volume of
output data. The technical analysis of this output can easily take hours
or days.</td>

<td>The output of <tt>grave-robber</tt> can take considerable space. For
example, for a system with 1.0 GB of data,&nbsp; <tt>grave-robber </tt>will
typically produce anywhere from 50 to 200 KB of output. You need to make
sure that you have set aside sufficient disk space to store the output.
During forensic analysis, changes to the system being analyzed should be
as small as possible. Therefore we recommend against storing the <tt>grave-robber
</tt>output
data on the disks being analyzed. In addition, if you need to search for
deleted files, any write access to the disks can destroy the valuable data
you are seeking.&nbsp;
<p>Make sure that spare disks are reserved and available when you need
them to store the <tt>grave-robber</tt> output. Make sure you know how
to connect such disks to a live system such that minimal changes occur
on the system being analyzed. In particular, ensure that no reboot occurs
to avoid killing running processes before you have a chance to grab information
about them with <tt>grave-robber</tt>.&nbsp;
<p>To reliably analyze any system, you must use unmodified, authentic tools.
Therefore, use write-protected media to store tools like the TCT and others
used during forensic analysis.</td>

the <tt>grave-robber</tt> output</font></font></b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>grave-robber</tt> can be used in three different modes.
The output will vary depending on the mode used as explained below.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Life system, default data collection:</li>

<br>By default, all data is collected except data only available by dumping
the memory content of system processes.&nbsp;
<li>
Life system, maximal data collection:</li>

<br>In addition to the default settings, information from active processes
is collected.&nbsp;
<li>
Backup copy or mounted disk of another system (corpse):</li>

<br>As no life system is available for analysis purposes, only the available
disk space is analyzed.</ol>
We recommended running <tt>grave-robber</tt> from a simple terminal if
a life system is being analyzed. The program may kill a windows system
while retrieving data from system processes!</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP>The availability of specific information depends on the
running operating system. TCT relies on native programs to collect as much
data as possible.&nbsp;
<p>Several directories and files are created within the directory used
to store all <tt>grave-robber</tt> output:&nbsp;
<p><b>Files:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<tt>coroner.log</tt></li>

<br>This file lists all program executions that were initiated with time
stamp information and arguments.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>error.log</tt></li>

<br>This file contains all error messages that occurred during the data
collection.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>body</tt></li>

<br>This is the <a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i046.01.html">mactime</a>
database which lists all attributes of all files examined such as its MD5
checksum, inode information, and access time stamps.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>body.S</tt></li>

<br>This file has the same structure as <tt>body</tt> but contains information
about SetUID files only.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>MD5_all</tt></li>

<br>This file lists all MD5 checksums for all output files generated by
<tt>grave-robber</tt>.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>MD5_all.md5</tt></li>

<br>This file lists the MD5 checksum of the file <tt>MD5_all</tt> only.
You can identify changes to the MD5 database file by comparing the actual
MD5 checksum with this file.</ol>
<b>Directories:</b>
<p>All files contained within these subdirectories are protected with a
MD5 checksum file. The name of this file is created by taking the original
file name used by <tt>grave_robber</tt> and adding <tt>.md5</tt> as an
extension.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<tt>command_out</tt></li>

<br>This subdirectory keeps the output of most of the programs that are
executed from within <tt>grave-robber</tt>. The files are named based on
the command run and its arguments.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>conf_vault</tt></li>

<br>All files that are of interest for <tt>grave-robber</tt> are copied
into this directory. This includes configuration files, critical files,
and directories, etc. The list of files is controlled by several configuration
files:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<tt>save_these_files</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>coroner.cf</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>grave-robber.cf</tt></li>
</ul>

<li>
<tt>pcat</tt></li>

<br><tt>pcat</tt> is used to recover images of running processes. Much
important information can be found in process memory such as IP addresses,
passwords, etc.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>proc</tt></li>

<br>This directory also contains images of running processes but based
on the <tt>proc</tt> file system.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>removed_but_running</tt></li>

<br>This directory contains all deleted files that were still open or running
at the time of data gathering.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>trust</tt></li>

<br>Within this directory, all files related to "trust" and trusted relationships
that could be exploited are copied. Currently this will grab <tt>.rhosts</tt>,
forward files, and dumps <tt>crontab</tt> and <tt>at</tt> output as well
as <tt>xhost</tt> / <tt>xauth</tt> results.&nbsp;
<li>
<tt>user_vault</tt></li>

<br>For all users, copies of sensitive files found while analyzing the
file system (such as SSH key files, history files for various shells, etc.)
are stored here.</ol>

your secured copy of TCT. (The creation of a secured copy based on a write-protected

Create this directory on all systems that may be used for forensic analysis
in advance of any incident. This will avoid your having to create this
directory in order to be able to mount the spare disk.&nbsp;
