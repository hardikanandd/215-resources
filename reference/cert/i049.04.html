<td VALIGN=TOP>During the course of routine systems administration, it
sometimes becomes necessary to disable a user’s accounts. One example is
that the account’s password may have been compromised. As a systems administrator,
you need to know how to disable an account and what disabling an account
means.&nbsp;
<p>Disabling an account effectively terminates a user's direct access path
to a computer system although it may not be a reliable containment action
because an intruder may have other means of access. Disabling an account
can successfully deny any further access if the account is the only means
used to gain access and no other means of access (backdoors, etc.) have
been installed.&nbsp;
<p>Keep in mind that you need to repeat this procedure every time you re-install
the system based on a backup that has the user account still enabled.&nbsp;
<p>If a user has access to many systems within your network, you may need
to repeat this procedure on all of those systems. If a user has accounts
(and, therefore, has to provide passwords) on many systems, he/she typically
chooses the same password. As a result, it is important to disable accounts
on all systems; otherwise an attacker may gain access via another system
with using the password of a compromised account.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>This implementation describes how to disable a user account on the Sun
Solaris operating system, version 2.x. This approach should also work with
many other UNIX operating systems and hosts. Please note that in addition
to the operating system, application systems may have their own account
management. For example, some web servers use an access scheme that is
also login- and password- based but does not use the standard <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>
and <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> files. This implementation does not address how
to disable such application-specific accounts.</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Execution of the following steps successfully disables all
standard access paths using a compromised account. As previously noted,
this does not cover any application-specific accounts nor does it cover
any backdoors that the intruder may have installed.&nbsp;
<p>Before performing these steps and if appropriate, make a full backup
of the system accessed by the intruder when using the compromised account.
Follow your organization's procedures for preserving evidence (as the backup
procedure might change the evidence when not done properly) when a computer
system has suffered a break-in and make sure to satisfy any chain-of-evidence
requirements. This, at a minimum, is required to support any subsequent
legal investigation or court proceedings.&nbsp;
<p>In the course of disabling an account, many files are transferred to
a protected location that is only accessible by the system's administrator.
This method may impact the availability of evidence to parties that may
need such access. We therefore recommend that you address these issues
before you start disabling any user account.&nbsp;
<p>We recommend that you begin this process by creating the following directory:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # mkdir /root/disabled_users


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # chmod 0700 /root/disabled_users</font></pre>
Note that this method creates files that the root user will be able to
read and manipulate. Therefore, if the intruder has become root on a compromised
system, these files will still be accessible to the intruder even though
they have been moved to another location.&nbsp;</td>

once you have confirmed that an intruder compromised an account. Given

you should archive it as soon as possible. A small but useful tool
called mactime (part of <tt><a href="http://www.fish.com/tct">The Coroner's Toolkit</a></tt>) can be used to do this:&nbsp;

<td VALIGN=TOP>Remove<tt> cron</tt> and <tt>at</tt> jobs being executed
by the account you are about to disable. You need to do this because these
jobs will execute even after the account is disabled. The wiley intruder
may create a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>at</tt> job to guard against a compromised
account being disabled. Such a job typically re-enables a disabled account,
thereby giving the intruder continued access to a system.&nbsp;
<p>To transfer any <tt>cron</tt> job, use the following command:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # mv /var/spool/cron/cronjobs/fred /root/disabled_users/fred/fred.cron</font></pre>
To transfer all <tt>at</tt> jobs for a user, all files belonging to that
user need to be specified:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # find /var/spool/cron/atjobs/* -user fred -print</font></pre>
This reveals all files belonging to the user and containing <tt>at</tt>
jobs. You then move the user's <tt>at</tt> files to a directory under the
newly created directory in the disabled account area. For example, if the
above command reveals that Fred owns the <tt>at</tt> job <tt>a0000300f66,
</tt>perform the following steps :&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # mkdir /root/disabled_users/fred/at


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # mv /var/spool/cron/atjobs/a0000300f66 /root/disabled_users/fred/at/</font></pre>
Finally, disable execution of <tt>at</tt> jobs by removing the user's name

the user's name into the file <tt>/usr/lib/cron/atd.deny</tt>.</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Transferring all user files to a protected subdirectory
saves them but prohibits them from being executed by ordinary users. To

<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # cd /users/fred

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # compress /root/disabled_users/fred/users.fred.tar</font></pre>
Once you are sure that all of the user’s files have been copied and compressed,&nbsp;
remove them from the user's home directory and also remove the home directory
itself.&nbsp;
<p>Files belonging to a disabled account can reside at any arbitrary place
in a file system in addition to those files residing within or below the
user's home directory. These files could be programs or scripts with the 
<tt>setuid</tt> bit enabled, which would provide an alternate access path
to the account. The following command identifies such files and allows manual
transfer to the protected subdirectory:&nbsp;
<pre><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # find / -local -user fred -print</font></pre>
Once you have copied these files into the protected subdirectory, you should
examine them for unusual characteristics such as an enabled <tt>setuid</tt>
bit or an unusual file type. Remove all files after they are copied. (If, however, other users are depending on these files, examine
the content of the files and their access rights before using them again.)</td>
