<TD VALIGN=top>This implementation example describes how to build, install
and configure NCSA Web server software, version 1.5.2a<SUP>1</SUP> on a
host running Sun Solaris version 2.5.1. In addition, recommended access
control settings will be covered for files and directories associated with
the Web server and the content it will be serving. It is assumed that you
have a Solaris development platform separate from the deployment Solaris
host. The deployment host should be prepared with a minimized, secure configuration

</TD>

<TD VALIGN=top>In the process of building, installing, and configuring
the Web server software and operating system details, you will be confronted
with a large number of options and settings which will affect the security
of the software and the way in which the software and system operate. These
include compilation settings, installation options and access controls,
and run-time configuration settings. Keep the following in mind when considering
what settings to enable and what values to assign: 
<UL>
<LI>Keep things simple. In general, the more settings you enable, the more
complex the security ramifications you have to consider will be. </LI>

<LI>Start with all options disabled, and then enable only those which you
absolutely require. Record the original default values in configuration
files and command line arguments for your reference. Then disable all settings
and (re)enable only those that are necessary for your requirements. </LI>

<LI>Beware of hidden defaults. The absence of an explicit setting does
not necessarily mean that it is disabled. Hidden defaults may change between
releases of software and in patches you apply to keep your software up-to-date.
Make all settings explicit, even if you intend to keep the default values.
</LI>

<LI>Document the settings you have made. Even if you are the only person
who will ever need to look at the configurations again, you will want to
record what settings you made and why, to help you later when reconfiguring
the server, diagnosing problems, or investigating security incidents. </LI>

<TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=120><B>Planning</B> </TD>

<TD VALIGN=top>Build a model of the Web server setup. Without a sufficient
understanding of how your Web server software operates, and how to deploy
it to implement your security and performance requirements, it will be
difficult for you to know what settings and options are appropriate to
build, install, and configure the software. You should be prepared to make
several attempts to get everything working correctly in your isolated test
environment. In some cases you may even have to modify parts of the software
to get the server to behave according to your requirements. Sketching out
your deployment ahead of time will help to guide you in determining necessary
settings and to document your implementation. 
<P>For example, one good security requirement is to prevent Web clients
and CGI programs from gaining access to sensitive areas of the system,
including the Web server logs, operating system programs and configuration
files. A common approach to enforcing this type of requirement is to set
up the Web server so that it operates within a chrooted environment. The
Web server is configured so that the root of the filesystem is effectively
moved to the top of a subtree of directories that contain only those programs
and files that are to be accessible to Web clients and CGI programs.</P>

<P>Implementing a chrooted environment for an NCSA server is illustrated
as follows: In its default installation, the NCSA Web server creates a
hierarchy in which the directories containing CGI programs and Web documents
accessed by Web clients are located at the same level. Figure 1 shows this
arrangement for an NCSA Web server installed under the default /usr/local/etc/httpd.</P>

<CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="80%" NOSHADE></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B>Figure 1: Default layout of NCSA Web server implementation</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="80%" NOSHADE></P></CENTER>

<P>In this default environment, files accessible to Web client programs
in the CGI program directory (cgi-bin), Web document directory (htdocs),
and graphics directory (icons), are located at the same level as the directories
containing the Web server program (bin), configuration files (conf) and
logs. It is convenient to have the bin, conf and logs directories at the
same level, but they must be protected against accidental or malicious
accesses. In addition, operating system utilities and data files called
upon by the Web server and CGI programs are accessed from system directories
(e.g., /usr/bin, /etc), which are likely to contain a variety of programs
and data which, for security reasons, should not be accessible.</P>

<P>To set up the chrooted environment, you recreate the arrangement of
directories necessary for normal operation of the server under a separate
subdirectory. You then copy only those operating system utilities and data
files necessary for operation of the server and cgi-programs to their corresponding
directories under the new separate subdirectory.</P>

<CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="80%" NOSHADE></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="80%" NOSHADE></P></CENTER>

<P>In the example depicted in Figure 2, the top of the Web server tree
has been moved to /www (instead of /usr/local/etc/httpd) to simplify and
shorten the path to it. The Web server program directory (bin), configuration
directory (conf), and logs directory effectively remain where they were
before. The chroot directory (/www/daemon_root) will appear to be the root
directory (/) when the Web server is running. In other words, when the
Web server is running, everything above the /www/daemon_root directory
is inaccessible to Web client and CGI programs because they see that directory
as /, above which they cannot navigate. Nevertheless, they can make use
of system utilities and data because those resources have been copied from
their original locations to the corresponding directory in the chrooted
environment.</P>

<P>The chrooted environment not only helps to simplify access controls
to sensitive parts of the server, but also facilitates the protection of
necessary sensitive files. For example, it is common for programs to refer
to the system's password file (/etc/passwd) to identify user names associated
with file ownership and access rights. In the conventional environment,
this makes the system's password file subject to undesirable exposure.
The copy of the /etc/passwd file in the chrooted environment need not have
all the entries of the original file; any sensitive information per record
in the file can be erased.</P>

<P>To implement the chrooted environment with the NCSA Web server software,
you will need to modify some of the httpd source code so that the server
software operates correctly. These source code changes are listed at the
end of this document.</P>

<P>In order to both protect configuration and log files from being compromised
and avoid interfering with the operation of the NCSA Web server as currently
implemented, we suggest a two step approach:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="data/Solaris.2.5.1/securelogs.tar">Download
the securelogs utility</A>. This tar file contains the sources and a binary
which lets the server write to log files within the chrooted environment
but which are physically located outside (in the example drawn above, in
/www/logs) and connected to the files within the chrooted environment (/www/daemon_root/logs)
via named pipes. Install the binary in <PRE>/www/bin</PRE></LI>

<LI>Ensure that the configuration files actually used by the WWW server on startup (located in the <PRE>/www/daemon_root/conf</PRE> directory) are the
same as those outside and more protected (in <PRE>/www/conf</PRE>) before starting the Web server. </LI>

<TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=120><B>Compiling the NCSA httpd program source code</B>
</TD>

<TD VALIGN=top>Since the public Web server host does not have the facilities
installed on it to compile and build software, the NCSA httpd Web server
software must be built on a separate, compatible development platform.
For this example, the server software will be compiled on a Sun Solaris
2.5.1 system with the developer system support software installed, and
using the freely available GNU C compiler<SUP>2</SUP>. 
<P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE><SUP>2</SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>
GNU C compiler (gcc), version 2.7.2, is available for <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc/">download</A>.</FONT>

<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>

<P>Carefully read the directions provided in the documentation accompanying
the httpd source code. Compilation options for NCSA httpd are set in the
src/Makefile and src/config.h files. All options (including non-security
options) should be thoroughly reviewed and explicitly set before you compile
the source code with make. </P>

<P>The SECURE_LOGS option in config.h should be turned on to prevent CGI
programs from accessing the httpd log files.<SUP>3</SUP> This will help
to prevent accidental and malicious modification of the Web server logs
via the CGI interface.</P>

<P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE><SUP>3</SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>
If logging capabilities are needed by the CGI programs, use separate application-specific
log facilities.</FONT> 
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>

<P>NCSA httpd version 1.5.2 optionally supports md5, kerberos v.4, and
kerberos v.5 authentication. However, these authentication mechanisms are
currently not supported by many Web client programs. If the clients you
expect to serve have such authentication turn them on in the src/config.h
and src/Makefiles files.</P>

<P>If you need to change compile-time options after having built the software,
be sure to remove binaries and object files produced during the previous
compilation before executing make again to rebuild the software. This is
necessary to ensure that your revised options are reflected in all applicable
components of the software, and that old object files are not incorporated
by mistake. To remove obsolete files execute the following command:</P>

<PRE>make clean</PRE>

<P>Afterward, check that there are no leftover obsolete object files and
binaries. </P>

<P>More specific changes are required to enable NCSA httpd 1.5.2 to operate
reasonably in a chrooted environment. <A HREF="tools/Solaris.2.5.1/ncsa-1.5.2a-patches.tar">Download
the required patches</A> and apply them to the sources in the src subdirectory.
Alternatively, you can directly <A HREF="tools/Solaris.2.5.1/ncsa-1.5.2a-mods.tar">download
the modified versions</A> of the three affected files and recompile them
to suit your needs.</P>

<P>Finally, you can directly <A HREF="tools/Solaris.2.5.1/ncsa-1.5.2a-httpd.tar">download
a binary file </A>that will work in the environment created in this and

<TD VALIGN=top>By default, the installation of httpd also results in the
installation of example CGI programs. Remove all scripts and reinstall
individually as needed and after careful review. Security holes found in
these programs are more likely to be exploited on a large scale, given
that these programs are present on a large number of hosts and that details
of exploitation will be distributed quickly. An example of such a security
hole is the phf CGI script (see <A HREF="/advisories/CA-96.06.cgi_example_code.html">CERT advisory

Assuming that you are going to use the chroot command to change the logical

<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>

<P>Running the parent httpd process as root allows the use of port 80,
a restricted port, which prevents a user process from masquerading as a
Web server. Port 80 is also the standard port for httpd servers. Running
the child processes as the user nobody limits the potential damage caused
if the server or a CGI program is coerced into executing foreign code.</P>

<P>See the practice on setting up the directory hierarchy for details on
what the user nobody is able to access. In brief, nobody should only be
allowed to access the minimal set of files it needs (i.e., static Web pages,
CGI programs, icons).</P>

<P>The ServerName option is set to the hostname. This option is necessary
for relative URLs to work correctly. The ServerAdmin option is set to the
electronic mail address of the person responsible for the maintenance of
the server. This enables external users to send mail to the right person
in case of problems with the server. Finally, the ServerRoot option is
set to the root directory of the server files. Since, in this case, the
server runs in a chroot environment, it is set to &quot;/&quot;. The server
then looks for log files in the directory /logs, configuration files in
/conf, etc.</P>

<P>All logging facilities should be turned on and the logs located in an
appropriate place (here in the logs directory in the ServerRoot directory).&nbsp;

<TD><B>Resource configuration (srm.conf)</B> 
<P>From a security perspective, set the options in srm.conf as follows:</P>

<PRE><TT>DocumentRoot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /htdocs
ScriptAlias&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /cgi-bin/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /cgi-bin/
Alias&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /icons/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /icons/
IndexIgnore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * */.??*</TT></PRE>

<P>The static Web pages and the CGI programs are separated into two different
directory trees to facilitate administrative control. CGI programs are
potential sources of weaknesses, given that they are executed with the
same privileges as the server. A hole in a CGI program can be as damaging
as a hole in the server. Moreover, holes in CGI programs are more frequent
than holes in the server, given that CGI programs are much less scrutinized
for such bugs. Collecting all CGI programs in one directory and allowing
only the Web master to write to the cgi-bin directory makes it easier to
prevent problems.</P>

<P>For now, setting IndexIgnore to &quot;* */.??*&quot; results in double
protection against inadvertent disclosure of information about a directory
since this forces all files to be ignored by the server when it prepares
a directory listing.</P>

<P>The source code of CGI programs should be kept outside the server hierarchy,
although it should not be assumed that the absence of source code access
alone prevents the exploitation of holes in CGI programs. The review of
CGI program source code should be done through alternate distribution channels.</P>

<P>More generally, only the necessary CGI programs should be kept in the
hierarchy. Previous versions, debugging version, default CGI programs which
were installed with the server should be removed or safeguarded in a separate
area.</P>

<P>By default, remove everything in the cgi-bin directory for a start.</P>

<TD><B>Access configuration (access.conf)</B> 
<PRE><TT>&lt;Directory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /cgi-bin&gt;
AllowOverride&nbsp;&nbsp; None
Options&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /htdocs&gt;

&lt;/Directory&gt;</TT></PRE>

<P>The configuration file access.conf contains options controlling authentication
and other file access features, such as server-side includes, automatic
index generation, and symbolic link handling. These directives are specified
for individual directories by enclosing then with the &lt;Directory&gt;
sectioning directive. If a directory has no directives associated with
it, values from its parent directory are used. If no directory in the path
has any directives associated with it, server defaults are used. </P>

<P>The access.conf file should not rely on server defaults, which may change
when the server is upgraded. Also, httpd servers are configured by default
for features, not for security. The access.conf file should at least contain
directives for the cgi-bin and htdocs directories.</P>

<P>In order to centralize access control, all access related options should
be set in the file access.conf. AllowOverride None prevents global directives
from being overridden by directives in .htaccess files.</P>

<P>Unless required by the specific application, all features should be
disabled using the Options directive. In the example above, no options
are enabled for the cgi-bin and htdocs directories.</P>

<P>If symbolic links are required by the application (e.g., to share pages
across directories), the SymLinksIfOwnerMatch option should be used. Otherwise,
following symbolic links should be disabled altogether. Disabling symbolic
links is especially important when local users can add files to the htdocs
hierarchy and, thus, create symbolic links to files they do not own.</P>

<P>The ExecCGI option should not be turned on. This option allows the execution
of CGI programs in the specified directory and is needed only when CGI
programs and static pages are mixed in the same hierarchy.</P>

<P>Server-side includes option should not be turned on.<SUP>5</SUP> Server-side
includes allow Web pages to contain information generated on the fly (e.g.,
the current date, number of hits). The execution of arbitrary programs
by users represents a security risk.</P>

<P>
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE><SUP>5</SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>
Server-side includes introduce a substantial performance penalty, since
they require the server to parse individual pages.</FONT> 
<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>

<P>Automatic index generation should not be turned on. Although indexes
do not present an intrinsic security risk, they may reveal too much information
to an outside user. The above setup for the /htdocs and /cgi-bin defaults
to not generating the index automatically.</P>

<P>Since no restrictions are required on access, we have not used the &lt;LIMIT&gt;
directives. This also removes the requirement to set up various authentication
schemes.</P>
