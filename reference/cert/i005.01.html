      <p> The ps (process status) program provides a snapshot of information for 
        processes currently executing on UNIX systems. You can specify a variety 
        of command-line options to control which processes this program reports 
        and what information it reports about each. For details of all of the 
        options and output values, consult the ps(1) manual pages. On Solaris 
        systems, ps is normally found in <font face="Courier New" size=3>/usr/bin</font>. 
        The table below lists some options that are particularly useful when investigating 
        processes on a Solaris 2.x system: </p>

      <p>If used by itself, the -e option reports the following information about 
        each process: the process ID (PID), the terminal on which the process 
        was initiated (TTY), the total time consumed by the process (TIME), and 
        the name of the program associated with the process (CMD). Since there 
        is no user ID reported with each process, it is difficult to know who 
        might be executing what. It is therefore common to combine the -e option 
        with the -f and -l options to produce more robust and readable output, 
        but as we will see in the example below, you have to be careful when interpreting 
        the information reported: </p>

      <p>At first glance, it would appear that nothing unusual is going on. Other 
        than a bunch of normal-looking processes run by root, user <font face="Courier New" size=3>othello</font> 
        has simply logged into his account, which uses the <font face="Courier New" size=3>/bin/csh</font> 
        shell. With the <font face="Courier New" size=3>-f</font> option, the 
        hyphen before <font face="Courier New" size=3>csh</font> in the CMD column 
        indicates that it is a login shell.</p>

      <p>Where did the snoop process suddenly come from? It is a network data 
        packet capturing program (also known as a packet sniffer) that should 
        be restricted for use only by authorized system administrators. If we 
        look at our earlier output from the <font face="Courier New" size=3>ps 
        -ef</font> command, the program name reported for this process is elm, 
        which is the name of a common mail client program. To investigate this, 
        let's take a look at the processes running on the terminal (TTY) from 
        which snoop is being executed: <font face="Courier New" size=2> </font></p>

      <p>Again, we see that with the -f option, the process appears as elm, but 
        without it, it appears as snoop (we'll get to why later). Notice that 
        user <font face="Courier New" size=2> othello </font>is logged in on pts/4.</p>
      <p>Now look at the process ID (PID) and parent process ID (PPID) fields. 
        The PID for snoop is 737. Its parent process (i.e., the process that spawned 
        it) is 736, which is the PID of the root-owned <font face="Courier New" size=3>sh</font> 
        process above it. The <font face="Courier New" size=3>sh</font> process's 
        parent is PPID 724, which is the process ID of <font face="Courier New" size=3>othello</font>'s<font face="Courier New" size=2> 
        </font>login shell. This means that whoever is logged in using the<font face="Courier New" size=3> 
        othello</font><font face="Courier New" size=2> </font>account has managed 
        to execute a root-owned <font face="Courier New" size=3>sh</font> shell 
        (i.e., an <font face="Courier New" size=3>sh</font> shell executing with 
        user root's privileges), and from it is capturing network traffic using 
        the snoop program. Unless the person logged in via the <font face="Courier New" size=3>othello</font><font face="Courier New" size=2> 
        </font>account is an authorized administrator performing authorized activities, 
        you have an intruder in your system. </p>
      <p>Now to the mystery of snoop being reported as elm. When you use the -f 
        option, it is important to note that the information reported in the CMD 
        field is the name of the program as the user entered it to initiate the 
        process. Without the -f option, the information in the CMD field is the 
        name of the actual program associated with the process. In this case, 
        elm was a name created as a symbolic link to the snoop program, located 
        in a directory that is in user <font face="Courier New" size=3>othello's</font><font face="Courier New" size=2> 
        </font>PATH environment setting. Thus when the person using the <font face="Courier New" size=3>othello</font><font face="Courier New" size=2> 
        </font>account entered the command, elm, the program that was actually 
        initiated was snoop. It is important to note here that since the snoop 
        program requires privileged access restricted to root, without the root-owned 
        shell, the scenario depicted above would not have succeeded. </p>
      <p>If you discover that a user has apparently acquired unauthorized root 
        access, you should consider it an extremely serious security breach, to 
        which you must respond immediately according to your organization's intrusion 
        response procedures. </p>

      <p>It is important to note that there are valid instances in which a regular

        <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font>, which is used to update 
        their users' passwords. The <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font>

      <p>The <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font> program is owned by 
        root and has its <font face="Courier New" size=3>setuid</font> and <font face="Courier New" size=3>setgid</font> 
        bits set (mode 6555). This means that when a user executes <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font>, 
        it runs with root's privileges, not the user's. We say that the real user 
        of <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font> is the user who the invoked 
        the program, but the effective user of the program is root. This difference 
        is illustrated when we use the ps program to list processes according 
        to real (-U) and effective (-u) users. In the examples below, merlin is 
        a user currently executing the <font face="Courier New" size=2>passwd</font>

        process, although its parent process ID is that of the <font face="Courier New" size=3>ksh</font> 
        login shell which belongs to <font face="Courier New" size=3>merlin</font>. 
        This means that the real user of both processes is <font face="Courier New" size=3>merlin</font>. 
        The last three examples illustrate that <font face="Courier New" size=2>merlin</font> 
        is not the effective user of the <font face="Courier New" size=3>passwd</font> 
        process. These examples also show that the command that <font face="Courier New" size=3>merlin</font> 
        entered to change his password is the same as the name of the actual program 
        executing, since the name in the CMD field is the same with and without 
        the -f option. </p>
